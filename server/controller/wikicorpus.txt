 andrew miller  publisher  andrew miller    mitchell held a seventy five percent interest in the magazine with the remainder by miller  both men retained their holdings until their deaths   miller served as secretary treasurer of the magazine and was very successful managing the business side of the operation  mitchell  a 37 year old illustrator who used a  10 000 inheritance to invest in the weekly magazine  served as its publisher  mitchell created the first   life   nameplate with   cupid  s as mascots  he later drew its masthead of a knight leveling his lance at the posterior of a fleeing devil  mitchell took advantage of a revolutionary new printing process using zinc coated plates  which improved the reproduction of his illustrations and artwork  this edge helped because   life   faced stiff competition from the best selling humor magazines     judge  magazine  judge     and   puck  magazine    puck      which were already established and successful    edward sandford martin   was brought on as   life s   first literary editor  the recent   harvard   graduate was a founder of the     harvard lampoon     the motto of the first issue of   life   was   while there s life  there s hope   the new magazine set forth its principles and policies to its readers   we wish to have some fun in this paper    we shall try to domesticate as much as possible of the casual cheerfulness that is drifting about in an unfriendly world    we shall have something to say about religion  about politics  fashion  society  literature  the stage  the stock exchange  and the police station  and we will speak out what is in our mind as fairly  as truthfully  and as decently as we know how   the magazine was a success and soon attracted the industry s leading contributors  among the most important was   charles dana gibson    three years after the magazine was founded  the   massachusetts   native sold   life   his first contribution for  4  a dog outside his kennel howling at the moon  encouraged by a publisher who was also an artist  gibson was joined in   life s   early days by such well known illustrators as   palmer cox    creator of the   brownie  elf  brownie       a  b  frost      oliver herford    and   e  w  kemble      life   attracted an impressive literary roster too    john kendrick bangs      james whitcomb riley    and   brander matthews   all wrote for the magazine around the start of the 20th century however    life   also had its dark side  mitchell was sometimes accused of outright   anti semitism    when the magazine blamed the theatrical team of   klaw   erlanger   for chicago s grisly   iroquois theater fire   in 1903  a national uproar ensued    life   s drama critic    james stetson metcalfe    was barred from the 47 manhattan theatres controlled by the so called   theatrical syndicate    his magazine hit back with terrible cartoons of grotesque jews with enormous noses   life   became a place that discovered new talent  this was particularly true among illustrators  in 1908   robert ripley   published his first cartoon in   life    20 years before his     ripley s believe it or not  believe it or not      fame    norman rockwell   s first cover for   life     tain t you   was published may 10  1917  rockwell s paintings were featured on   life   s cover 28 times between 1917 and 1924    rea irvin    the first

gibson   dreamed up its most celebrated figure  his creation  the   gibson girl    was a tall  regal beauty  after her early   life   appearances in the 1890s  the gibson girl became the nation s feminine ideal  the gibson girl was a publishing sensation and earned a place in fashion history this version of   life   took sides in politics and international affairs  and published fiery pro american editorials  mitchell and gibson were incensed when   germany   attacked   belgium    in 1914 they undertook a campaign to push america into the war  mitchell s seven years spent at   paris   art schools made him partial to the french  there wasn t a shred of unbiased coverage of the war  gibson drew the   kaiser   as a bloody madman  insulting   uncle sam    sneering at crippled soldiers  and even shooting red cross nurses  mitchell lived just long enough to see   life s   crusade result in the u  s  declaration of war in 1917 following mitchell s death in 1918  gibson bought the magazine for  1 million  but the world was a different place for gibson s publication  it was not the   gay nineties   where family style humor prevailed and the chaste gibson girls wore floor length dresses    world war i   had spurred changing tastes among the magazine reading public    life   s brand of fun  clean  cultivated  humor began to pale before the new variety  crude  sexy  and cynical

in february 1925  copied many of the features and styles of   life    it even raided its editorial and art departments  another blow to   life   s circulation came from raunchy humor periodicals such

the magazine lost money and subscribers  by the time maxwell and editor   george eggleston   took over    life   had switched from publishing weekly to monthly  the two men went to work revamping its editorial style to meet the times  and in the process it did win new readers    life   struggled to make a profit in the 1930s when   henry luce   pursued purchasing it announcing the death of   life    maxwell declared   we cannot claim  like mr    gene tunney    that we resigned our championship undefeated in our prime  but at least we hope to retire gracefully from a world still friendly  for   life   s final issue in its original format  80 year old edward sandford martin was recalled from editorial retirement to compose its obituary  he wrote   that life should be passing into the hands of new owners and directors is of the liveliest interest to the sole survivor of the little group that saw it born in january 1883    as for me  i wish it all good fortune  grace  mercy and peace and usefulness to a distracted world that does not know which way to turn nor what will happen to it next  a wonderful time for a new voice to make a noise that needs to be heard    it spawned many imitators  such as     look  american magazine  look      which was founded just a year later in 1937  and folded in 1971   life   got its own building at 19 west 31st street  a   beaux arts

retirement in 1970  his influence was significant during the magazine s heyday   roughly from 1936 until the mid 1960s  thompson was known for the free rein he gave his editors  particularly a  trio

story in   life   is scurrilous     i d just call it a yellow magazine and let it go at that    the article was considered so dangerous to the war effort that it was   censorship in the united states wartime censorship censored   from copies of the magazine sold outside north america     was taken by george strock in february 1943  but was not published until september 1943  it was the first time an image of dead american troops appeared in   life   during world war ii without the bodies being draped  in coffins  or otherwise covered up  this and other graphic pictures were given approval by the office of war information s censors  in part because president roosevelt feared that the american public were becoming complacent about the war   when the u  s  entered the war in 1941  so did

gallery of art national gallery   agreed to put 117 on exhibition that summer    life    in its patriotism  also supported the military s efforts to document the war with artists  when congress forbid the military from using government money to fund artists in the field    life   privatized much of the programs hiring some of the same artists who were fired by the military  many works created by the   life   artists were turned over to the dod and its art programs  such as the   united states army art program    on december 7  1960     the magazine employed the distinguished war photographer

the   life   photography darkroom ensued after a mishap ruined dozens of capa s photos that were taken during the beach landing  the magazine claimed in its captions that the photos were fuzzy because capa s hands were shaking  he denied it  he later poked fun at   life   by titling his memoir   slightly out of focus    in 1954  capa was killed while working for the magazine while covering the   first indochina war   after stepping on a   landmine      life   photographer bob landry also went in with the first wave at d day   but   all   of landry s film was lost  and his shoes to boot   each week during   world war ii   the magazine brought the war home to americans  it had photographers in all theaters of war  from the pacific to europe   the magazine was so iconic that it was imitated in enemy   propaganda   using contrasting images of   life   and   death    in may 1950 the council of ministers in   cairo   banned   life   from   egypt    forever   all issues on sale were confiscated   no reason was given  but egyptian officials expressed indignation over the april 10  1950  story about   king farouk   of egypt  entitled the  problem king of egypt    the government considered it insulting to the country   life   in the 1950s earned a measure of respect by commissioning work from top authors   after   life   s publication in 1952 of   ernest hemingway   s     the old man and the sea      the magazine contracted with the author for a 4 000 word piece on bullfighting   hemingway sent the editors a 10 000 word article  following his last visit to   spain   in

the u s   further raising interest in lsd in the mass media   following wasson s report    timothy leary   visited mexico to experience the mushrooms   life s   motto became   to see life  see the world    in the post war years it published some of the most memorable images of events in the united states and the world   it also produced many popular science serials such as     the world we live in     and   the epic of man   in the early 1950s   the magazine continued to showcase the work of notable illustrators  including    alton s  tobey    whose many contributions included the cover for a 1958 series of articles on the history of the russian revolution the magazine was losing readers as the 1950s drew to a close   in may 1959 it announced plans to reduce its regular newsstand price to 19 cents a copy from 25 cents   with the increase in television sales and viewership  interest in news magazines was waning     life   would need to reinvent itself     the 1960s and the end of an

 taylor said   i don t think i want to be one  sex symbol kind of suggests bathrooms in hotels or something  i do know i m a movie star and i like being a woman  and i think sex is absolutely gorgeous  but as far as a sex goddess  i don t worry myself that way    richard is a very sexy man  he s got that sort of jungle essence that one can sense    when we look at each other  it s like our eyes have fingers and they grab ahold    i think i ended up being the scarlet woman because of my rather puritanical upbringing and beliefs  i couldn t just have a romance  it had to be a marriage   in the 1960s  the magazine s photographs featured those by   gordon parks     the camera is my weapon against the things i dislike about the universe and how i show the beautiful things about the universe   parks recalled in 2000   i didn t care about life magazine  i cared about the people   he said  on march 25  1966    life   had the drug   lsd    which was still not criminalized  as its cover story  in march 1967   life   won the 1967   national magazine award    chosen by the   columbia university graduate school of journalism    the prestigious award paid tribute to the stunning photos coming out of the war in   southeast asia    such as   henri huet   s riveting series of a wounded medic that were published in january 1966  increasingly  the photos that   life   was printing of the war in vietnam were searing images of death and loss   on the cover of   life     however  despite the accolades the magazine continued to win  and publishing america s mission to the moon in 1969  circulation was lagging  it was announced in january 1971 that   life   would reduce its circulation from 8 5 million to 7 million in an effort to offset shrinking advertising revenues  exactly one year later    life   cut its circulation from 7 million to 5 5 million beginning with the january 14  1972  issue  publisher gary valk announced    life   was reportedly not losing money  but its costs were rising faster than its profits    life   lost credibility with many readers when it supported   clifford irving    whose fraudulent autobiography of   howard hughes   was revealed as a hoax in january 1972  the magazine had purchased serialization rights to irving s manuscript industry figures showed that some 96 percent of   life s   circulation went to mail subscribers  with only 4 percent coming from the more profitable newsstand sales  valk was at the helm as publisher when hundreds lost their jobs  the end came when the weekly   life   magazine published its last issue on december 29th 1972 from 1972 to 1978  time inc  published ten   life special reports   on such themes as  the spirit of israel    remarkable american women  and  the year in pictures   with a minimum of promotion  those issues sold between 500 000 and 1 million copies at cover prices of up to  2     as a monthly  1978 2000       unreferenced section date november 2010    section or date november 2010  in 1978    life   re emerged as a monthly  and with this resurrection came a new  modified logo  although still the familiar red rectangle with the white type  the new version was larger  and the lettering was closer together and the box surrounding it was smaller   this  new  larger logo would be used on every issue until july 1993    life   continued for the next 22 years as a moderately successful general interest news features magazine  in 1986  it decided to mark its 50th anniversary under the time inc  umbrella with a special issue showing every   life   cover starting from 1936  which of course included the issues that were published during the six year hiatus in the 1970s  the circulation in this era hovered around the 1 5 million circulation mark  the cover price in 1986 was  2 50  the publisher at the time was charles whittingham  the editor was philip kunhardt    life   also got to go back to war in 1991  and it did so just like in the 1940s  four issues of this weekly   life in time of war   were published during the first   gulf war   hard times came to the magazine once again  and in february 1993   life   announced the magazine would be printed on smaller pages starting with its july issue  this issue would also mark the return of the original   life   logo also at this time    life   slashed advertising prices 34 percent in a bid to make the monthly publication more appealing to advertisers  the magazine reduced its circulation guarantee for advertisers by 12 percent in july 1993 to 1 5 million copies from the current 1 7 million  the publishers in this era were nora mcaniff and edward mccarrick    daniel okrent   was the editor    life   for the first time was the same trim  size as its longtime time inc  sister publication    fortune  magazine    fortune     the magazine was back in the national consciousness upon the death in august 1995 of   alfred eisenstaedt    the   life   photographer whose pictures constitute some of the most enduring images of the 20th century  eisenstaedt s photographs of the famous and infamous  mdash    adolf hitler   and   benito mussolini      marilyn monroe      ernest hemingway    the kennedys    sophia loren    mdash  won him worldwide renown and 86   life   covers in 1999 the magazine was suffering financially  but still made news by compiling lists to round out the 20th century    life   editors ranked its most important events of the millennium   this list has been criticized for being overly focused on western achievements  the   history of china chinese    for example  had invented type four centuries before   johannes gutenberg gutenberg    but with thousands of   ideograms    found its use impractical    life   also published a list of the 100 most important people of the millennium  this list  too  was criticized for focusing on the west  also    thomas edison   s number one ranking was challenged since there were others whose inventions  the   internal combustion engine    the automobile  electricity making machines  for example  had greater impact than edison s  the top 100 most important people list was further criticized for mixing world famous names  such as   isaac newton      albert einstein      louis pasteur    and   leonardo da vinci    with numerous americans largely unknown outside of the united states  18 americans compared to 13 italians and french  11 english  it appeared that the money losing magazine was just hanging on to make it into the 21st century  and it almost did  in march 2000  time inc  announced it would cease regular publication of   life   with the may issue  seven months before the century s end   it s a sad day for us here     don logan    chairman and chief executive of time inc   told cnnfn com   it was still in the black   he said  noting that   life   was increasingly spending more to maintain its monthly circulation level of approximately 1 5 million   life was a general interest magazine and since its reincarnation  it had always struggled to find its identity  to find its position in the marketplace   logan said   the magazine also farewelled its core subject  in 1936 its first issue featured a baby named george story with the headline  life begins  and over the years it updated its readers about the course of his life as he married  had children and pursued a career as a journalist  when time announced its pending closure in march  george soon then died from heart failure on april 4  2000  the final issue of   life   was appropriately titled  a life ends   for   life   subscribers  remaining subscriptions were honored with other time inc  magazines  such as   time    and in january 2001  these subscribers received a special    life   sized format of  the year in pictures  edition of   time   magazine  which was in reality a   life   issue disguised under a   time   logo on the front   newsstand copies of this edition were actually published under the   life   imprint  while citing poor advertising sales and a rough climate for selling magazine subscriptions  time inc  executives said a key reason for closing the title in 2000 was to divert resources to the company s other magazine launches that year  such as     real simple      later that year  its parent company    time warner    struck a deal with the   tribune company   for   times mirror   magazines that included   golf  ski  skiing  field   stream    and   yachting      life   was not around when   aol   and   time warner   announced their  184 billion merger  the largest corporate merger in history  which was finalized in january 2001    life   was absent from the u s  market for only a few months  when it began publishing special newsstand  megazine  issues on topics such as   9 11   and the   holy land   in 2001  these issues  which were printed on thicker paper  were more like softcover books than magazines    newspaper supplement  2004 07    beginning in october 2004  it was revived for

magazine time     founder   henry luce   bought the magazine in 1936 solely so that he could acquire the rights to its name  a weekly news magazine launched by luce in 1936  with a strong emphasis on   photojournalism      life   was published weekly until 1972  as an intermittent  special  until 1978  and as a monthly from 1978 to 2000   a weekly newspaper supplement published by time inc  from 2004 to 2007 and included in some american newspapers  a website  life com  from march 2009 to january 2012  a joint venture with getty images under the name see your world  llc  from january 30  2012  a photo channel on time comthe   life   founded in 1883 was similar to     puck  magazine  puck     and was published for 53 years as a general interest   light entertainment   magazine  heavy on illustrations  jokes and social commentary  it featured some of the greatest writers  editors and cartoonists of its era  including   charles dana gibson      norman rockwell    and   harry oliver    during its later years  this magazine offered brief capsule reviews  similar to those in     the new yorker      of plays and movies currently running in   new york city    but with the innovative touch of a colored typographic bullet appended to each review  resembling a traffic light  green for a positive review  red for a negative one  amber for mixed notices the luce   life   was the first all photographic american news magazine  and it dominated the market for more than 40 years  the magazine sold more than 13 5 million copies a week at one point and was so popular that president   harry s  truman    sir   winston churchill   and general   douglas macarthur   all serialized their memoirs in its pages  luce purchased the rights to the name from the publishers of the first   life   but sold its subscription list and features to another magazine  there was no editorial continuity between the two publications perhaps one of the best known pictures printed in the magazine was alfred eisenstaedt s   v j day in times square photograph of a nurse in a sailor s arms    snapped on august 27  1945  as they celebrated   victory over japan day vj day   in   new york city    the magazine s place in the history of   photojournalism   is considered its most important contribution to publishing   life   was wildly successful for two generations before its prestige was diminished by economics and changing tastes  since 1972    life   has twice ceased publication and resumed in a different form  before ceasing once again with the issue dated april 20  2007  the brand name continues on the internet and in occasional special issues     humor and general interest magazine     life   was founded january 4  1883  in a   new york city   artist s studio at 1155 broadway as a partnership between   john ames mitchell   and   andrew miller  publisher  andrew miller    mitchell held a seventy five percent interest in the magazine with the remainder by miller  both men retained their holdings until their deaths   miller served as secretary treasurer of the magazine and was very successful managing the business side of the operation  mitchell  a 37 year old illustrator who used a  10 000 inheritance to invest in the weekly magazine  served as its publisher  mitchell created the first   life   nameplate with   cupid  s as mascots  he later drew its masthead of a knight leveling his lance at the posterior of a fleeing devil  mitchell took advantage of a revolutionary new printing process using zinc coated plates  which improved the reproduction of his illustrations and artwork  this edge helped because   life   faced stiff competition from the best selling humor magazines     judge  magazine  judge     and   puck  magazine    puck      which were already established and successful    edward sandford martin   was brought on as   life s   first literary editor  the recent   harvard   graduate was a founder of the     harvard lampoon     the motto of the first issue of   life   was   while there s life  there s hope   the new magazine set forth its principles and policies to its readers   we wish to have some fun in this paper    we shall try to domesticate as much as possible of the casual cheerfulness that is drifting about in an unfriendly world    we shall have something to say about religion  about politics  fashion  society  literature  the stage  the stock exchange  and the police station  and we will speak out what is in our mind as fairly  as truthfully  and as decently as we know how   the magazine was a success and soon attracted the industry s leading contributors  among the most important was   charles dana gibson    three years after the magazine was founded  the   massachusetts   native sold   life   his first contribution for  4  a dog outside his kennel howling at the moon  encouraged by a publisher who was also an artist  gibson was joined in   life s   early days by such well known illustrators as   palmer cox    creator of the   brownie  elf  brownie       a  b  frost      oliver herford    and   e  w  kemble      life   attracted an impressive literary roster too    john kendrick bangs      james whitcomb riley    and   brander matthews   all wrote for the magazine around the start of the 20th century however    life   also had its dark side  mitchell was sometimes accused of outright   anti semitism    when the magazine blamed the theatrical team of   klaw   erlanger   for chicago s grisly   iroquois theater fire   in 1903  a national uproar ensued    life   s drama critic    james stetson metcalfe    was barred from the 47 manhattan theatres controlled by the so called   theatrical syndicate    his magazine hit back with terrible cartoons of grotesque jews with enormous noses   life   became a place that discovered new talent  this was particularly true among illustrators  in 1908   robert ripley   published his first cartoon in   life    20 years before his     ripley s believe it or not  believe it or not      fame    norman rockwell   s first cover for   life     tain t you   was published may 10  1917  rockwell s paintings were featured on   life   s cover 28 times between 1917 and 1924    rea irvin    the first art director of     the new yorker     and creator of eustace tilley  got his start drawing covers for   life   just as pictures would later become   life s   most compelling feature    charles dana gibson   dreamed up its most celebrated figure  his creation  the   gibson girl    was a tall  regal beauty  after her early   life   appearances in the 1890s  the gibson girl became the nation s feminine ideal  the gibson girl was a publishing sensation and earned a place in fashion history this version of   life   took sides in politics and international affairs  and published fiery pro american editorials  mitchell and gibson were incensed when   germany   attacked   belgium    in 1914 they undertook a campaign to push america into the war  mitchell s seven years spent at   paris   art schools made him partial to the french  there wasn t a shred of unbiased coverage of the war  gibson drew the   kaiser   as a bloody madman  insulting   uncle sam    sneering at crippled soldiers  and even shooting red cross nurses  mitchell lived just long enough to see   life s   crusade result in the u  s  declaration of war in 1917 following mitchell s death in 1918  gibson bought the magazine for  1 million  but the world was a different place for gibson s publication  it was not the   gay nineties   where family style humor prevailed and the chaste gibson girls wore floor length dresses    world war i   had spurred changing tastes among the magazine reading public    life   s brand of fun  clean  cultivated  humor began to pale before the new variety  crude  sexy  and cynical    life   struggled to compete on news stands with such risqu  rivals    by f  x  leyendecker   in 1920 gibson selected former     vanity fair  magazine  vanity fair     staffer   robert e  sherwood   to be editor  a   world war i   veteran and member of the   algonquin round table    sherwood tried to inject sophisticated humor onto the pages    life   published   ivy league   jokes  cartoons    flapper   sayings and all burlesque issues  beginning in 1920   life   undertook a crusade against   prohibition    it also tapped the humorous writings of   frank sullivan  writer  frank sullivan      robert benchley      dorothy parker      franklin pierce adams   and   corey ford    among the illustrators and cartoonists were   ralph barton      percy crosby      don herold      ellison hoover      h  t  webster      art young   and   john held  jr   despite such all star talents on staff    life   had passed its prime  and was sliding toward financial ruin      the new yorker      debuting in february 1925  copied many of the features and styles of   life    it even raided its editorial and art departments  another blow to   life   s circulation came from raunchy humor periodicals such as   ballyhoo   and     hooey      which ran what can be termed outhouse gags      esquire  magazine  esquire     joined   life   s competitors in 1933  a little more than three years after purchasing   life    gibson quit and turned the decaying property over to publisher   clair maxwell   and treasurer   henry richter  treasurer  henry richter    gibson retired to   maine   to paint and lost active interest in the magazine  which he left deeply in the red   life   had 250 000 readers in 1920 but as the   jazz age   rolled into the great depression  the magazine lost money and subscribers  by the time maxwell and editor   george eggleston   took over    life   had switched from publishing weekly to monthly  the two men went to work revamping its editorial style to meet the times  and in the process it did win new readers    life   struggled to make a profit in the 1930s when   henry luce   pursued purchasing it announcing the death of   life    maxwell declared   we cannot claim  like mr    gene tunney    that we resigned our championship undefeated in our prime  but at least we hope to retire gracefully from a world still friendly  for   life   s final issue in its original format  80 year old edward sandford martin was recalled from editorial retirement to compose its obituary  he wrote   that life should be passing into the hands of new owners and directors is of the liveliest interest to the sole survivor of the little group that saw it born in january 1883    as for me  i wish it all good fortune  grace  mercy and peace and usefulness to a distracted world that does not know which way to turn nor what will happen to it next  a wonderful time for a new voice to make a noise that needs to be heard    it spawned many imitators  such as     look  american magazine  look      which was founded just a year later in 1937  and folded in 1971   life   got its own building at 19 west 31st street  a   beaux arts architecture   jewel built in 1894 and considered of  outstanding significance  by the new york landmarks preservation commission  later it moved editorial offices to 9   rockefeller plaza       success    luce pulled a stringer for   time      edward kramer thompson    to become assistant picture editor in 1937  from 1949 1961 he was the managing editor and editor in chief  until his retirement in 1970  his influence was significant during the magazine s heyday   roughly from 1936 until the mid 1960s  thompson was known for the free rein he gave his editors  particularly a  trio of formidable and colorful women    sally kirkland  editor  sally kirkland    fashion editor    mary letherbee    movie editor  and   mary hamman    modern living editor   in august 1942  writing of labor and racial unrest in   detroit      life   warned that  the morale situation is perhaps the worst in the u  s      it is time for the rest of the country to sit up and take notice  for detroit can either blow up   adolf hitler hitler   or it can blow up the u  s    mayor edward j  jeffries was outraged   i ll match detroit s patriotism against any other city s in the country  the whole story in   life   is scurrilous     i d just call it a yellow magazine and let it go at that    the article was considered so dangerous to the war effort that it was   censorship in the united states wartime censorship censored   from copies of the magazine sold outside north america     was taken by george strock in february 1943  but was not published until september 1943  it was the first time an image of dead american troops appeared in   life   during world war ii without the bodies being draped  in coffins  or otherwise covered up  this and other graphic pictures were given approval by the office of war information s censors  in part because president roosevelt feared that the american public were becoming complacent about the war   when the u  s  entered the war in 1941  so did   life     by 1944 not all of   time   and   life   s forty war correspondents were men  six were newswomen     mary welsh hemingway      margaret bourke white

publisher s letter  may 8  1944  as being part of the magazine s team  reported on the war for the company   life   was pro american and backed the war effort each week  in july 1942    life   launched its first art contest for soldiers and drew more than 1 500 entries  submitted by all ranks  judges sorted out the best and awarded  1 000 in prizes     life   picked sixteen for reproduction in the magazine   washington s   national gallery of art national gallery   agreed to put 117 on exhibition that summer    life    in its patriotism  also supported the military s efforts to document the war with artists  when congress forbid the military from using government money to fund artists in the field    life   privatized much of the programs hiring some of the same artists who were fired by the military  many works created by the   life   artists were turned over to the dod and its art programs  such as the   united states army art program    on december 7  1960     the magazine employed the distinguished war photographer   robert capa    a veteran of     collier s weekly collier s     magazine  capa was among the first wave of the   d day   invasion in   normandy  france    on june 6  1944  a notorious controversy at the   life   photography darkroom ensued after a mishap ruined dozens of capa s photos that were taken during the beach landing  the magazine claimed in its captions that the photos were fuzzy because capa s hands were shaking  he denied it  he later poked fun at   life   by titling his memoir   slightly out of focus    in 1954  capa was killed while working for the magazine while covering the   first indochina war   after stepping on a   landmine      life   photographer bob landry also went in with the first wave at d day   but   all   of landry s film was lost  and his shoes to boot   each week during   world war ii   the magazine brought the war home to americans  it had photographers in all theaters of war  from the pacific to europe   the magazine was so iconic that it was imitated in enemy   propaganda   using contrasting images of   life   and   death    in may 1950 the council of ministers in   cairo   banned   life   from   egypt    forever   all issues on sale were confiscated   no reason was given  but egyptian officials expressed indignation over the april 10  1950  story about   king farouk   of egypt  entitled the  problem king of egypt    the government considered it insulting to the country   life   in the 1950s earned a measure of respect by commissioning work from top authors   after   life   s publication in 1952 of   ernest hemingway   s     the old man and the sea      the magazine contracted with the author for a 4 000 word piece on bullfighting   hemingway sent the editors a 10 000 word article  following his last visit to   spain   in 1959 to cover a series of contests between two top   torero  bullfighter  matadors    the article was republished in 1985 as the novella   the dangerous summer    in february 1953  just a few weeks after leaving office  president   harry s  truman   announced that   life   magazine would handle all rights to his memoirs   truman said it was his belief that by 1954 he would be able to speak more fully on subjects pertaining to the role his administration played in world affairs   truman observed that   life   editors had presented other memoirs with great dignity  he added that   life   also made the best offer   dorothy dandridge   was the first african american woman to appear on the cover of the magazine in november 1954 in 1957    r  gordon wasson    the vice president of   j p morgan    published an article in life extolling the virtues of   magic mushrooms     this prompted   albert hofmann   to isolate   psilocybin   in 1958 for distribution by   sandoz   alongside   lsd   in the u s   further raising interest in lsd in the mass media   following wasson s report    timothy leary   visited mexico to experience the mushrooms   life s   motto became   to see life  see the world    in the post war years it published some of the most memorable images of events in the united states and the world   it also produced many popular science serials such as     the world we live in     and   the epic of man   in the early 1950s   the magazine continued to showcase the work of notable illustrators  including    alton s  tobey    whose many contributions included the cover for a 1958 series of articles on the history of the russian revolution the magazine was losing readers as the 1950s drew to a close   in may 1959 it announced plans to reduce its regular newsstand price to 19 cents a copy from 25 cents   with the increase in television sales and viewership  interest in news magazines was waning     life   would need to reinvent itself     the 1960s and the end of an era      s photograph of thomas cole featured on the cover of   life     in the 1960s the magazine was filled with color photos of movie stars  president   john f  kennedy   and his family  the war in   vietnam    and the   apollo program    typical of the magazine s editorial focus was a long 1964 feature on actress   elizabeth taylor   and her relationship to actor   richard burton    reporter   richard meryman jr    traveled with taylor to   new york      california    and   paris      life   ran a 6 000 word first person article on the screen star   i m not a  sex queen  or a  sex symbol     taylor said   i don t think i want to be one  sex symbol kind of suggests bathrooms in hotels or something  i do know i m a movie star and i like being a woman  and i think sex is absolutely gorgeous  but as far as a sex goddess  i don t worry myself that way    richard is a very sexy man  he s got that sort of jungle essence that one can sense    when we look at each other  it s like our eyes have fingers and they grab ahold    i think i ended up being the scarlet woman because of my rather puritanical upbringing and beliefs  i couldn t just have a romance  it had to be a marriage   in the 1960s  the magazine s photographs featured those by   gordon parks     the camera is my weapon against the things i dislike about the universe and how i show the beautiful things about the universe   parks recalled in 2000   i didn t care about life magazine  i cared about the people   he said  on march 25  1966    life   had the drug   lsd    which was still not criminalized  as its cover story  in march 1967   life   won the 1967   national magazine award    chosen by the   columbia university graduate school of journalism    the prestigious award paid tribute to the stunning photos coming out of the war in   southeast asia    such as   henri huet   s riveting series of a wounded medic that were published in january 1966  increasingly  the photos that   life   was printing of the war in vietnam were searing images of death and loss   on the cover of   life     however  despite the accolades the magazine continued to win  and publishing america s mission to the moon in 1969  circulation was lagging  it was announced in january 1971 that   life   would reduce its circulation from 8 5 million to 7 million in an effort to offset shrinking advertising revenues  exactly one year later    life   cut its circulation from 7 million to 5 5 million beginning with the january 14  1972  issue  publisher gary valk announced    life   was reportedly not losing money  but its costs were rising faster than its profits    life   lost credibility with many readers when it supported   clifford irving    whose fraudulent autobiography of   howard hughes   was revealed as a hoax in january 1972  the magazine had purchased serialization rights to irving s manuscript industry figures showed that some 96 percent of   life s   circulation went to mail subscribers  with only 4 percent coming from the more profitable newsstand sales  valk was at the helm as publisher when hundreds lost their jobs  the end came when the weekly   life   magazine published its last issue on december 29th 1972 from 1972 to 1978  time inc  published ten   life special reports   on such themes as  the spirit of israel    remarkable american women  and  the year in pictures   with a minimum of promotion  those issues sold between 500 000 and 1 million copies at cover prices of up to  2     as a monthly  1978 2000     in 1978    life   re emerged as a monthly  and with this resurrection came a new  modified logo  although still the familiar red rectangle with the white type  the new version was larger  and the lettering was closer together and the box surrounding it was smaller   this  new  larger logo would be used on every issue until july 1993    life   continued for the next 22 years as a moderately successful general interest news features magazine  in 1986  it decided to mark its 50th anniversary under the time inc  umbrella with a special issue showing every   life   cover starting from 1936  which of course included the issues that were published during the six year hiatus in the 1970s  the circulation in this era hovered around the 1 5 million circulation mark  the cover price in 1986 was  2 50  the publisher at the time was charles whittingham  the editor was philip kunhardt    life   also got to go back to war in 1991  and it did so just like in the 1940s  four issues of this weekly   life in time of war   were

this issue would also mark the return of the original   life   logo also at this time    life   slashed advertising prices 34 percent in a bid to make the monthly publication more appealing to advertisers  the magazine reduced its circulation guarantee for advertisers by 12 percent in july 1993 to 1 5 million copies from the current 1 7 million  the publishers in this era were nora mcaniff

won him worldwide renown and 86   life   covers in 1999 the magazine was suffering financially  but still made news by compiling lists to round out the 20th century    life   editors ranked its most important events of the millennium   this list has been criticized for being overly focused on western achievements  the   history of china chinese    for example  had invented type four centuries before   johannes gutenberg gutenberg    but with thousands of   ideograms    found its use impractical    life   also published a list of the 100 most important people of the millennium  this list  too  was criticized for focusing on the west  also    thomas edison   s number one ranking was challenged since there were others whose inventions  the   internal combustion engine    the automobile  electricity making machines  for example  had greater impact than edison s  the top 100 most important people list was further criticized for mixing world famous names  such as   isaac newton      albert einstein      louis pasteur    and   leonardo da vinci    with numerous americans largely unknown outside of the united states  18 americans compared to 13 italians and french  11 english  it appeared that the money losing magazine was just hanging on to make it into the 21st century  and it almost did  in march 2000  time inc  announced it would cease regular publication of   life   with the may issue  seven months before the century s end   it s a sad day for us here     don logan    chairman and chief executive of time inc   told cnnfn com   it was still in the black   he said  noting that   life   was increasingly spending more to maintain its monthly circulation level of approximately 1 5 million   life was a general interest magazine and since its reincarnation  it had always struggled to find its identity  to find its position in the marketplace   logan said   the magazine also farewelled its core subject  in 1936 its first issue featured a baby named george story with the headline  life begins  and over the years it updated its readers about the course of his life as he married  had children and pursued a career as a journalist  when time announced its pending closure in march  george soon then died from heart failure on april 4  2000  the final issue of   life   was appropriately titled  a life ends   for   life   subscribers  remaining subscriptions were honored with other time inc  magazines  such as   time    and in january 2001  these subscribers received a special    life   sized format of  the year in pictures  edition of   time   magazine  which was in reality a   life   issue disguised under a   time   logo on the front   newsstand copies of this edition were actually published under the   life   imprint  while citing poor advertising sales and a rough climate for selling magazine subscriptions  time inc  executives said a key reason for closing the title in 2000 was to divert resources to the company s other magazine launches that year  such as     real simple      later that year  its parent company    time warner    struck a deal with the   tribune company   for   times mirror   magazines that included   golf  ski  skiing  field

consist in their correspondence with reality  but in their usefulness and efficacy  ref name  rorty   the late 19th century   american philosophy american philosophers     charles sanders peirce   and

 and   hilary putnam      phenomenology     edmund husserl   s   phenomenology  philosophy  phenomenology   was an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for an account of the structure of conscious experience in general  ref name  ref 1    an important part of husserl s phenomenological project was to show that all conscious acts are directed at or about objective content  a feature that husserl called     intentionality      ref name  dreyfus   in the first part of his two volume work  the   logical investigations    1901   he launched an extended attack on   psychologism    in the second part  he began to develop the technique of   descriptive phenomenology    with the aim of showing how objective judgments are indeed grounded in conscious experience not  however  in the first person experience of particular individuals  but in the properties essential to any experiences of the kind in question  ref name  ref 1   he also attempted to identify the essential properties of any act of meaning  he developed the method further in   ideas    1913  as   transcendental phenomenology    proposing to ground actual experience  and thus all fields of human knowledge  in the structure of consciousness of an ideal  or   transcendence  philosophy  transcendental    ego  later  he attempted to reconcile his transcendental standpoint with an acknowledgement of the intersubjective   life world   in which real individual subjects interact  husserl published only a few works in his lifetime  which treat phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms  but he left an enormous quantity of unpublished concrete analyses husserl s work was immediately influential in germany  with the foundation of phenomenological schools in munich and g ttingen  phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as   martin heidegger    formerly husserl s research assistant     maurice merleau ponty    and   jean paul sartre    indeed  through the work of heidegger and sartre  husserl s focus on subjective experience influenced aspects of   existentialism      existentialism   existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of late 19th  and 20th century philosophers who  despite profound doctrinal differences  ref name  existentialism    ref name  philosophy25    shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject not merely the thinking subject  but the acting  feeling  living human individual  ref name  existentialism26    in existentialism  the individual s starting point is characterized by what has been called  the existential attitude   or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world  ref name  existentialism27    many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy  in both style and content  as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience  ref name  existentialism28    ref name  existentialism29      although they did not use the term  the 19th century philosophers   s ren kierkegaard   and   friedrich nietzsche   are widely regarded as the fathers of existentialism  their influence  however  has extended beyond existentialist thought  ref name  kierkegaard    ref name  bob    ref name  existentialists   the main target of kierkegaard s writings was the idealist philosophical system of   hegel   which  he thought  ignored or excluded the inner subjective life of living human beings  kierkegaard  conversely  held that  truth is subjectivity   arguing that what is most important to an actual human being are questions dealing with an individual s inner relationship to existence  in particular  kierkegaard  a christian  believed that the truth of religious faith was a subjective question  and one to be wrestled with passionately  ref name  fear and trembling    ref name  concluding unscientific postscript   although kierkegaard and nietzsche were among his influences  the extent to which the german philosopher   martin heidegger   should be considered an existentialist is debatable  in     being and time     he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence    dasein    to be analysed in terms of existential categories    existentiale     and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement  however  in   the letter on humanism    heidegger explicitly rejected the existentialism of   jean paul sartre   sartre became the best known proponent of existentialism  exploring it not only in theoretical works such as     being and nothingness      but also in plays and novels  sartre  along with   simone de beauvoir    represented an avowedly atheistic branch of existentialism  which is now more closely associated with their ideas of nausea  contingency  bad faith  and the absurd than with kierkegaard s spiritual angst  nevertheless  the focus on the individual human being  responsible before the universe for the authenticity of his or her existence  is common to all these thinkers    structuralism and post structuralism      inaugurated by the linguist   ferdinand de saussure    structuralism sought to clarify systems of signs through analyzing the   discourse  s they both limit and make possible  saussure conceived of the sign as being delimited by all the other signs in the system  and ideas as being incapable of existence prior to linguistic structure  which articulates thought  this led continental thought away from humanism  and toward what was termed the decentering of man  language is no longer spoken by man to express a true inner self  but language speaks man structuralism sought the province of a hard science  but its positivism soon came under fire by poststructuralism  a wide field of thinkers  some of whom were once themselves structuralists  but later came to criticize it  structuralists believed they could analyze systems from an external  objective standing  for example  but the poststructuralists argued that this is incorrect  that one cannot transcend structures and thus analysis is itself determined by what it examines  while the distinction between the signifier and signified was treated as crystalline by structuralists  poststructuralists asserted that every attempt to grasp the signified results in more signifiers  so meaning is always in a state of being deferred  making an ultimate interpretation impossible structuralism came to dominate continental philosophy throughout the 1960s and early 1970s  encompassing thinkers as diverse as   claude l vi strauss      roland barthes   and   jacques lacan    post structuralism came to predominate over the 1970s onwards  including thinkers such as   michel foucault      jacques derrida      gilles deleuze   and even   roland barthes    it incorporated a critique of structuralism s limitations    the analytic tradition   the term   analytic philosophy   roughly designates a group of philosophical methods that stress detailed argumentation  attention to semantics  use of classical logic and non classical logics and clarity of meaning above all other criteria  some have held that philosophical problems arise through misuse of language or because of misunderstandings of the logic of our language  while some maintain that there are genuine philosophical problems and that philosophy is continuous with science    michael dummett   in his   origins of analytical philosophy   makes the case for counting   gottlob frege   s   the foundations of arithmetic   as the first analytic work  on the grounds that in that book frege took the linguistic turn  analyzing philosophical problems through language    bertrand russell   and   g e  moore   are also often counted as founders of analytic philosophy  beginning with their rejection of british idealism  their defense of realism and the emphasis they laid on the legitimacy of analysis  russell s classic works   the principles of mathematics    ref name  russell        on denoting     and     principia mathematica     with   alfred north whitehead    aside from greatly promoting the use of mathematical logic in philosophy  set the ground for much of the research program in the early stages of the analytic tradition  emphasizing such problems as  the reference of proper names  whether  existence  is a property  the nature of propositions  the analysis of definite descriptions  the discussions on the foundations of mathematics  as well as exploring issues of ontological commitment and even metaphysical problems regarding time  the nature of matter  mind  persistence and change  which russell tackled often with the aid of mathematical logic  russell and moore s philosophy  in the beginning of the 20th century  developed as a critique of   hegel   and his british followers in particular  and of grand systems of   speculative philosophy   in general  though by no means all analytic philosophers reject the philosophy of hegel  see   charles taylor  philosopher  charles taylor    nor speculative philosophy  some schools in the group include   logical positivism    and   ordinary language philosophy ordinary language   both markedly influenced by russell and wittgenstein s development of   logical atomism   the former positively and the latter negatively in 1921    ludwig wittgenstein    who studied under russell at cambridge  published his     tractatus logico philosophicus      which gave a rigidly  logical  account of linguistic and philosophical issues  at the time  he understood most of the problems of philosophy as mere puzzles of language  which could be solved by investigating and then minding the logical structure of language  years later  he reversed a number of the positions he set out in the   tractatus    in for example his second major work      philosophical investigations      1953     investigations   was influential in the development of  ordinary language philosophy   which was promoted by   gilbert ryle      j l  austin    and a few others  in the united states  meanwhile  the philosophy of   w v o  quine   was having a major influence  with such classics as   two dogmas of empiricism    in that paper quine criticizes the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements  arguing that a clear conception of analyticity is unattainable  he argued for holism  the thesis that language  including scientific language  is a set of interconnected sentences  none of which can be verified on its own  rather  the sentences in the language depend on each other for their meaning and truth conditions  a consequence of quine s approach is that language as a whole has only a thin relation to experience  some sentences that refer directly to experience might be modified by sense impressions  but as the whole of language is theory laden  for the whole language to be modified  more than this is required  however  most of the linguistic structure can in principle be revised  even logic  in order to better model the world  notable students of quine include   donald davidson  philosopher  donald davidson   and   daniel dennett    the former devised a program for giving a semantics to natural language and thereby answer the philosophical conundrum  what is meaning    a crucial part of the program was the use of   alfred tarski   s semantic theory of truth  dummett  among others  argued that truth conditions should be dispensed within the theory of meaning  and replaced by assertibility conditions  some propositions  on this view  are neither true nor false  and thus such a theory of meaning entails a rejection of the   law of the excluded middle    this  for dummett  entails antirealism  as russell himself pointed out in his   an inquiry into meaning and truth      by the 1970s there was a renewed interest in many traditional philosophical problems by the younger generations of analytic philosophers    david kellogg lewis david lewis      saul kripke      derek parfit   and others took an interest in traditional metaphysical problems  which they began exploring by the use of logic and philosophy of language  among those problems some distinguished ones were  free will    essentialism    the nature of personal identity  identity over time  the nature of the mind  the nature of causal laws  space time  the properties of material beings  modality  etc  in those universities where analytic philosophy has spread  these problems are still being discussed passionately  analytic philosophers are also interested in the methodology of analytic philosophy itself  with   timothy williamson    wykeham professor of logic at oxford  publishing recently a book entitled   the philosophy of philosophy    some influential figures in contemporary analytic philosophy are  timothy williamson    david kellogg lewis david lewis      john searle      thomas nagel      hilary putnam      michael dummett      peter van inwagen   and   saul kripke    analytic philosophy has sometimes been accused of not contributing to the political debate or to traditional questions in aesthetics  however  with the appearance of     a theory of justice     by   john rawls   and     anarchy  state and utopia     by   robert nozick    analytic political philosophy acquired respectability  analytic philosophers have also shown depth in their investigations of aesthetics  with   roger scruton      nelson goodman      arthur danto   and others developing the subject to its current shape   applied philosophy   the ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs  the applied study of philosophy yields applications such as those in   ethics     applied ethics   in particular and   political philosophy    the political and economic philosophies of   confucius      sun tzu sun zi      chanakya      ibn khaldun      ibn rushd      ibn taimiyyah      niccol  machiavelli      gottfried wilhelm leibniz      john locke      jean jacques rousseau      adam smith      karl marx      john stuart mill      mahatma gandhi      martin luther king jr     and others all of these have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions in the field of   philosophy of education    progressive education as championed by   john dewey   has had a profound impact on educational practices in the   united states   in the 20th century  descendants of this movement include the current efforts in   philosophy for children    which are part of   philosophy education      carl von clausewitz   s political   philosophy of war   has had a profound effect on   public administration statecraft      international politics    and   military strategy   in the 20th century  especially in the years around   world war ii    logic has become crucially important in   mathematics      linguistics      psychology      computer science    and   computer engineering   other important applications can be found in   epistemology    which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge  sound evidence  and justified belief  important in   law      economics      decision theory    and a number of other disciplines   the   philosophy of science   discusses the underpinnings of the   scientific method   and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation  as such  philosophy has fundamental implications for science as a whole  for example  the strictly empirical approach of skinner s behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the american psychological establishment    deep ecology   and   animal rights   examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non human occupants to consider also    aesthetics   can help to interpret discussions of   music      literature    the   plastic arts    and the whole artistic dimension of life  in general  the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields often philosophy is seen as an investigation into an area not sufficiently well understood to be its own branch of knowledge  what were once philosophical pursuits have evolved into the modern day fields such as   psychology      sociology      linguistics    and   economics    for example   see also    wikipedia books      list of important publications in philosophy      list of years in philosophy

comprehensible    a still more broad definition includes everything that has existed  exists  or will exist   philosophers      mathematicians    and other ancient and modern thinkers  such as   aristotle      plato      gottlob frege frege      ludwig wittgenstein wittgenstein    and   bertrand russell russell    have made a distinction between   thought   corresponding to reality  coherent abstractions  thoughts of things that are imaginable but not real   and that which cannot even be   reason rationally   thought  by contrast     existence     is often restricted solely to that which has   nature physical existence   or has a direct basis in it in the way that thoughts do in the brain reality is often contrasted with what is imaginary    delusional     only  in the   mind      dream  s  what is   lie false    what is   fictional    or what is   abstraction abstract    at the same time  what is abstract plays a role both in everyday life and in   academia academic   research  for instance    causality      virtue      life   and   distributive justice   are abstract concepts that can be difficult to define  but they are only rarely equalled with pure delusions  both the existence and reality of abstractions is in dispute  one extreme position regard them as mere words  another position regard them as higher truths than less abstract concepts  this disagreement is the basis of the philosophical   problem of universals   the   truth   refers to what is real  while   falsity   refers to what is not    fiction  s are considered not real   related concepts     see also      truth   and   fact       reality  world views  and theories of reality    a common colloquial usage would have   reality   mean  perceptions  beliefs  and attitudes toward reality   as in  my reality is not your reality   this is often used just as a   colloquialism   indicating that the parties to a conversation agree  or should agree  not to quibble over deeply different conceptions of what is real  for example  in a religious discussion between friends  one might say  attempting humor    you might disagree  but in my reality  everyone goes to heaven  reality can be defined in a way that links it to world views or parts of them  conceptual frameworks   reality is the totality of all things  structures  actual and conceptual   events  past and present  and phenomena  whether observable or not  it is what a world view  whether it be based on individual or shared human experience  ultimately attempts to describe or map certain ideas from physics  philosophy  sociology    literary criticism    and other fields shape various theories of reality  one such belief is that there simply and literally   is   no reality beyond the perceptions or beliefs we each have about reality  such attitudes are summarized in the popular statement   perception is reality  or  life is how you perceive reality  or  reality is what you can get away with     robert anton wilson     and they indicate   anti realism   nbsp  ndash  that is  the view that there is no objective reality  whether acknowledged explicitly or not many of the concepts of science and philosophy are often defined   culture culturally   and   sociology socially    this idea was elaborated by   thomas kuhn   in his book     the structure of scientific revolutions      1962       the social construction of reality      a book about the   sociology of knowledge   written by   peter l  berger   and   thomas luckmann    was published in 1966    western philosophy     philosophy   addresses two different aspects of the topic of reality  the nature of reality itself  and the relationship between the   mind    as well as   language   and   culture    and reality on the one hand    ontology   is the study of being  and the central topic of the field is couched  variously  in terms of being  existence   what is   and reality  the task in ontology is to describe the most general   category of being categories of reality   and how they are interrelated  if a philosopher wanted to proffer a positive definition of the concept  reality   it would be done under this heading  as explained above  some philosophers draw a distinction between reality and existence  in fact  many analytic philosophers today tend to avoid the term  real  and  reality  in discussing ontological issues  but for those who would treat  is real  the same way they treat  exists   one of the leading questions of analytic philosophy has been whether existence  or reality  is a property of objects  it has been widely held by analytic philosophers that it is   not   a property at all  though this view has lost some ground in recent decades on the other hand  particularly in discussions of   objectivity  philosophy  objectivity   that have feet in both   metaphysics   and   epistemology    philosophical discussions of  reality  often concern the ways in which reality is  or is not  in some way   dependent upon    or  to use fashionable   jargon     constructed  out of  mental and cultural factors such as perceptions  beliefs  and other mental states  as well as cultural artifacts  such as   religion  s and   political movement  s  on up to the vague notion of a common cultural   world view    or  em lang  de    weltanschauung    em  the view that there is a reality independent of any beliefs  perceptions  etc   is called   philosophical realism realism    more specifically  philosophers are given to speaking about  realism   about    this and that  such as realism about universals or realism about the external world  generally  where one can identify any class of object  the existence or essential characteristics of which is said not to depend on perceptions  beliefs  language  or any other human artifact  one can speak of  realism   about    that object one can also speak of   anti   realism about the same objects      anti realism     is the latest in a long series of terms for views opposed to realism  perhaps the first was   idealism  philosophy  idealism    so called because reality was said to be in the mind  or a product of our   ideas      berkeleyan idealism   is the view  propounded by the irish   empiricism empiricist     george berkeley    that the objects of perception are actually ideas in the mind  in this view  one might be tempted to say that reality is a  mental construct   this is not quite accurate  however  since in berkeley s view perceptual ideas are created and coordinated by god  by the 20th century  views similar to berkeley s were called   phenomenalism    phenomenalism differs from berkeleyan idealism primarily in that berkeley believed that minds  or souls  are not merely ideas nor made up of ideas  whereas varieties of phenomenalism  such as that advocated by   bertrand russell russell    tended to go farther to say that the mind itself is merely a collection of perceptions  memories  etc   and that there is no mind or soul over and above such   mental event  s  finally  anti realism became a fashionable term for   any   view which held that the existence of some object depends upon the mind or cultural artifacts  the view that the so called external world is really merely a social  or cultural  artifact  called   social constructionism    is one variety of anti realism    cultural relativism   is the view that   social issues   such as morality are not absolute  but at least partially   cultural artifact   a   correspondence theory   of   knowledge   about what exists claims that  true  knowledge of reality represents accurate correspondence of statements about and images of reality with the actual reality that the statements or images are attempting to represent  for example  the   scientific method   can   empiricism verify   that a statement is true based on the observable evidence that a thing exists  many humans can point to the   rocky mountains   and say that this   mountain range   exists  and continues to exist even if no one is observing it or making statements about it    being   the nature of   being   is a perennial topic in metaphysics  for  instance   parmenides   taught that reality was a single unchanging being  whereas   heraclitus   wrote that all things flow  the 20th century philosopher   heidegger   thought previous philosophers have lost sight the question of being  qua being  in favour of the questions of beings  existing things   so that a return to the parmenidean approach was needed  an   ontological catalogue   is an attempt to list the fundamental constituents of reality  the question of whether or not   existence   is a   wikt predicate predicate   has been discussed since the early modern period  not least in relation to the   ontological argument for the existence of god    existence    that   something is  has been contrasted with     essence      the question of   what   something is since existence without essence seems blank  it associated with   nothingness   by philosophers such as hegel    nihilism   represents an extremely negative view of being  the   absolute  philosophy  absolute   a positive one     perception    the question of   direct realism direct or  na ve  realism    as opposed to   indirect realism indirect or  representational  realism    arises in the   philosophy of perception   and   philosophy of mind of mind   out of the debate over the nature of   consciousness conscious     qualia experience      the   epistemology epistemological   question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by   neural   processes in our   human brain brain      na ve realism   is known as   direct   realism when developed to counter   indirect   or representative realism  also known as epistemological   dualism     the   philosophy philosophical   position that our conscious experience is not of the real world itself but of an internal representation  a miniature   virtual reality virtual reality   replica of the world   timothy leary   coined the influential term   reality_tunnel reality tunnel    by which he means a kind of   representative realism    the theory states that  with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from their beliefs and experiences  every individual interprets the same world differently  hence  truth is in the eye of the beholder   his ideas influenced the work of his friend   robert anton wilson       abstract objects and mathematics    the status of   abstraction  mathematics  abstract   entities  particularly numbers  is a topic of discussion in mathematics in the   philosophy of mathematics    the best known form of realism about numbers is   platonic realism    which grants them abstract  immaterial existence  other forms of realism identify mathematics with the concrete physical universe anti realist stances include   formalism  mathematics  formalism   and   mathematical fictionalism fictionalism   some approaches are selectively realistic about some mathematical objects but not others    finitism   rejects   infinity infinite   quantities    ultra finitism   accepts finite quantities up to a certain amount    constructivism  mathematics  constructivism   and   intuitionism   are realistic about objects that can be explicitly constructed  but reject the use of the   principle of the excluded middle   to prove existence by   reductio ad absurdum   the traditional debate has focused on whether an abstract  immaterial  intelligible  realm of numbers has existed   in addition to   the physical  sensible  concrete  world  a recent development is the   mathematical universe hypothesis    the theory that   only   a mathematical world exists  with the finite  physical world being an illusion within it an extreme form of realism about mathematics is the   mathematical multiverse hypothesis   advanced by   max tegmark    tegmark s sole postulate is    all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically    that is  in the sense that  in those  worlds  complex enough to contain self aware substructures  they  will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically  real  world     the hypothesis suggests that worlds corresponding to different sets of initial conditions  physical constants  or altogether different equations should be considered real  the theory can be considered a form of   platonism   in that it posits the existence of mathematical entities  but can also be considered a   philosophy of mathematics mathematical monism   in that it denies that anything exists except mathematical objects     properties    the problem of universals is an ancient problem in   metaphysics   about whether   universal  metaphysics  universals   exist  universals are general or abstract qualities  characteristics    property  philosophy  properties    kinds or   relation  philosophy  relation  s  such as being male female  solid liquid gas or a certain colour   that can be predicated of individuals or particulars or that individuals or particulars can be regarded as sharing or participating in  for example  scott  pat  and chris have in common the universal quality of   being human   or   humanity   the realist school claims that universals are real nbsp  ndash  they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them  there are various forms of realism  two major forms are   platonic realism   and   aristotelian realism       platonic realism   is the view that universals are real entities and they exist independent of particulars    aristotelian realism    on the other hand  is the view that universals are real entities  but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them   nominalism   and   conceptualism   are the main forms of anti realism about universals     time and space    a traditional   philosophical realism realist   position in   ontology   is that time and space have existence apart from the human mind    idealism idealists   deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind  some   anti realism anti realists   whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist  nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space   immanuel kant kant    in the     critique of pure reason      described time as an     a priori and a posteriori a priori     notion that  together with other   a priori   notions such as   space    allows us to comprehend   empirical evidence sense experience    kant denies that either space or time are   substance theory substance    entities in themselves  or learned by experience  he holds rather that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience  spatial   measurement  s are used to   quantity quantify   how far apart   physical body object  s are  and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between  or duration of    spacetime basic concepts event  s  althoughspace and time are held to be   transcedentally ideal   in this sense  they are also   empirically real    i e  not mere illusions idealist writers such as   j  m  e  mctaggart   in     the unreality of time     have argued that time is an illusion as well as differing about the reality of time as a whole  metaphysical theories of   time   can differ in their ascriptions of reality to the   past      present   and   future   separately     presentism  philosophy of time  presentism   holds that the past and future are unreal  and only an ever changing present is real   the   block universe   theory  also known as eternalism  holds that past  present and future are all real  but the passage of time is an illusion  it is often said to have a scientific basis in   theory of relativity relativity     the   growing block universe   theory holds that past and present are real  but the future is not time  and the related concepts of process and   evolution   are central to the   system building metaphysics   of   a  n  whitehead   and   charles hartshorne       possible worlds    the term    possible world    goes back to   gottfried wilhelm leibniz leibniz s   theory of possible worlds  used to analyse   necessity      logical possibility possibility    and similar   modal logic modal notions      modal realism   is the view  notably propounded by   david kellogg lewis    that all   possible worlds   are as real as the actual world  in short  the actual world is regarded as merely one among an   infinity infinite     set theory set   of   logically possible   worlds  some  nearer  to the actual world and some more remote  other theorists may use the possible world framework to express and explore problems without committing to it ontologically possible world theory is related to   alethic logic    a proposition is   necessary   if it is true in all possible worlds  and   possible   if it is true in at least one  the   many worlds interpretation   of quantum mechanics is a similar idea in science    theories of everything  toe  and philosophy   the philosophical implications of a physical toe are frequently debated  for example  if philosophical   physicalism   is true  a physical toe will coincide with a philosophical theory of everything the   metaphysics styles_and_methods_of_metaphysics  system building    style of   metaphysics   attempts to answer   all   the important questions in a coherent way  providing a complete picture of the world    plato   and   aristotle   could be said to be early examples of comprehensive systems  in the early modern period  17th and 18th centuries   the system building   scope   of philosophy is often linked to the ratioanlist   method   of philosophy that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure   a priori   reason  examples from the early modern period include the   gottfried leibniz leibniz   s   monadology      ren  descartes descarte   s   dualism      baruch spinoza spinoza   s   monism      georg wilhelm friedrich hegel hegel   s   absolute idealism   and   alfred north whitehead whitehead   s   process philosophy   were later systems other philosophers do not believe its techniques can aim so high  some scientists think a more mathematical approach than philosophy is needed for a toe  for instance   stephen hawking   wrote in     a brief history of time     that even if we had a toe  it would necessarily be a set of equations  he wrote   what is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe       phenomenological reality   on a much broader and more subjective level private experiences  curiosity  inquiry  and the selectivity involved in personal interpretation of events shapes reality as seen by one and only one individua and hence is called   phenomenology  philosophy  phenomenological    while thisform of reality might be common to others as well  it could at times also be so unique to oneself as to never be experienced or agreed upon by anyone else  much of the kind of experience deemed   spirituality spiritual   occurs on this level of reality phenomenology is a   philosophical method   developed in the early years of the twentieth century by   edmund husserl   and a circle of followers at the universities of   g ttingen   and   munich   in   germany    subsequently  phenomenological themes were taken up by philosophers in france  the united states  and elsewhere  often in contexts far removed from husserl s work the word   phenomenology   comes from the   greek language greek     phain menon    meaning  that which appears   and   l gos    meaning  study   in husserl s conception  phenomenology is primarily concerned with making the structures of   consciousness    and the   phenomena   which appear in acts of consciousness  objects of systematic reflection and analysis  such reflection was to take place from a highly modified    first person narrative first person    viewpoint  studying phenomena not as they appear to  my  consciousness  but to any consciousness whatsoever  husserl believed that phenomenology could thus provide a firm basis for all human   knowledge    including scientific knowledge  and could establish philosophy as a  rigorous science   husserl s conception of phenomenology has been criticised and developed not only by himself  but also by his student and assistant   martin heidegger    by   existentialists    such as   maurice merleau ponty      jean paul sartre    and by other philosophers  such as   paul ricoeur      emmanuel levinas    and   dietrich von hildebrand       skeptical hypotheses   skeptical hypotheses in philosophy suggest that reality is very different from what we think it is  or at least that we cannot prove it is not  examples include   the    brain in a vat    hypothesis is cast in scientific terms  it supposes that one might be a disembodied brain kept alive in a vat  and fed false sensory signals  by a   mad scientist     the    dream argument    of descartes and   zhuangzi   supposes reality to be indistinguishable from a dream   descarte s   evil demon   is a being  as clever and deceitful as he is powerful  who has directed his entire effort to misleading me    the   five minute hypothesis    or   omphalos hypothesis   or   last thursdayism    suggests that the world was created recently together with records and traces indicating a greater age   the   matrix hypothesis   or   simulated reality hypothesis   suggest that we might be inside a   computer simulation   or   virtual reality     physical sciences     scientific realism     scientific realism   is  at the most general level  the view that the world described by science  perhaps ideal science  is the real world  as it is  independent of what we might take it to be  within   philosophy of science    it is often framed as an answer to the question  how is the success of science to be explained   the debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of entities that are   unobservables not directly observable   discussed by   scientific theory scientific theories    generally  those who are scientific realists state that one can make reliable claims about these entities  viz   that they have the same   ontology ontological   status  as directly observable entities  as opposed to   instrumentalism      realism and locality in physics     realism   in the sense used by physicists does not equate to   philosophical realism realism   in   metaphysics    the latter is the claim that the world is mind independent  that even if the results of a measurement do not pre exist the act of measurement  that does not require that they are the creation of the observer  furthermore  a mind independent property does not have to be the value of some physical variable such as position or   momentum    a property can be     disposition  al    or potential   i e  it can be a tendency  in the way that glass objects tend to break  or are disposed to break  even if they do not   actually   break  likewise  the mind independent properties of quantum systems could consist of a tendency to respond to particular measurements with particular values with ascertainable probability   such an ontology would be metaphysically realistic  without being realistic in the physicist s sense of  local realism   which would require that a single value be produced with certainty  a closely related term is   counterfactual definiteness    cfd   used to refer to the claim that one can meaningfully speak of the definiteness of results of measurements that have not been performed  i e  the ability to assume the existence of objects  and properties of objects  even when they have not been measured    local realism   is a significant feature of classical mechanics  of   general relativity    and of   electrodynamics    but   quantum mechanics   has shown that   quantum entanglement   is possible  this was rejected by einstein  who proposed the   epr paradox    but it was subsequently quantified by   bell s inequalities     if bell s inequalities are violated  either local realism   or     counterfactual definiteness   must be incorrect  but some physicists dispute that experiments have demonstrated bell s violations  on the grounds that the sub class of   bells_theorem two_classes_of_bell_inequalities inhomogeneous bell inequalities   has not been tested or due to   bell test loopholes experimental limitations in the tests    different   interpretation of quantum mechanics interpretations of quantum mechanics   violate different parts of local realism and or   counterfactual definiteness      role of the observer in quantum mechanics   the   quantum mind body problem   refers to the philosophical discussions of the   mind body problem   in the context of   quantum mechanics    since quantum mechanics involves   quantum superposition  s  which   measurement in quantum mechanics are not perceived by observers    some   interpretations of quantum mechanics   place conscious observers in a special position the founders of quantum mechanics debated the role of the observer  and of them    wolfgang pauli   and   werner heisenberg   believed that it was the observer that produced   wave function collapse collapse    this point of view  which was never fully endorsed by   niels bohr    was denounced as mystical and anti scientific by   albert einstein    pauli accepted the term  and described quantum mechanics as   lucid mysticism    heisenberg and bohr always described quantum mechanics in   logical positivism logical positivist   terms  bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his   complementarity  physics  complementarity    for example   he believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature  albeit one that is simply ill suited for everyday experiences nbsp  ndash  which are better described by classical mechanics and probability  bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical  he believed that it was not a question of physics  but one of philosophy   eugene wigner   reformulated the    schr dinger s cat      thought experiment   as    wigner s friend    and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line which precipitates   wave function collapse collapse of the wave function    independent of any realist interpretation  commonly known as    consciousness causes collapse     this   interpretation of quantum mechanics interpretation   of quantum mechanics states that   observation   by a   conscious   observer is what makes the wave function collapse    multiverse   the   multiverse   is the   hypothetical   set of multiple possible   universe  s  including the historical universe we consistently experience  that together comprise everything that   exists    the entirety of   space      time      matter    and   energy   as well as the   physical law  s and   physical constant constants   that describe them  the term was coined in 1895 by the american philosopher and psychologist   william james     in the   many worlds interpretation    mwi   one of the mainstream   interpretations of quantum mechanics    there are an infinite number of universes and every possible quantum outcome occurs in at least one universe  the structure of the multiverse  the nature of each universe within it and the relationship between the various constituent universes  depend on the specific multiverse hypothesis considered  multiverses have been hypothesized in   cosmology      physics      astronomy      religion      philosophy      transpersonal psychology   and   fiction    particularly in   science fiction   and   fantasy    in these contexts  parallel universes are also called  alternative universes    quantum universes    interpenetrating dimensions    parallel dimensions    parallel worlds    alternative realities    alternative timelines   and  dimensional planes   among others    scientific theories of everything   a   theory of everything    toe  is a putative   theory   of   theoretical physics   that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena  and predicts the outcome of   any   experiment that could be carried out   in principle    the theory of everything is also called the    final theory      many candidate theories of everything have been proposed by theoretical physicists during the twentieth century  but none have been confirmed experimentally  the primary problem in producing a toe is that   general relativity   and   quantum mechanics   are hard to unify  this is one of the   unsolved problems in physics   initially  the term  theory of everything  was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories  for example  a great grandfather of   ijon tichy    a character from a cycle of   stanis aw lem   s   science fiction   stories of the 1960s  was known to work on the  general theory of everything   physicist   john ellis  physicist  john ellis    claims to have introduced the term into the technical literature in an article in     nature  magazine  nature     in 1986   over time  the term stuck in popularizations of   quantum physics   to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all   fundamental interaction  s and of all particles of nature    general relativity   for gravitation  and the   standard model standard model   of elementary particle physics nbsp  ndash  which includes quantum mechanics nbsp  ndash  for electromagnetism  the two nuclear interactions  and the known elementary particles current candidates for a theory of everything include   string theory      m theory    and   loop quantum gravity     technology     virtual reality and cyberspace     virtual reality    vr  is a term that applies to   computer simulation computer simulated   environments that can simulate physical presence in places in the real world  as well as in imaginary worlds   image virtuality continuum 2 jpg thumb right 400px reality virtuality continuum   the   virtuality continuum   is a continuous scale ranging between the completely virtual  a   virtual reality virtuality    and the completely real  reality  the reality virtuality continuum therefore encompasses all possible variations and compositions of real and   virtuality virtual   objects  it has been described as a concept in   new media   and   computer science    but in fact it could be considered a matter of   anthropology    the concept was first introduced by paul milgram  the area between the two extremes  where both the real and the virtual are mixed  is the so called   mixed reality    this in turn is said to consist of both   augmented reality    where the virtual augments the real  and   augmented virtuality    where the real augments the virtual

language oral   and   sign language  s contain a   phonology phonological   system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or   morpheme  s  and a   syntax syntactic   system that governs how words and   morphemes   are combined to form phrases and utterances  human language is unique because it has the properties of   productivity  linguistics  productivity      recursivity    and   displacement  linguistics  displacement    and because it relies entirely on social convention and learning  its complex structure therefore affords a much wider range of possible expressions and uses than any known system of   animal communication    language is thought to have originated when early   hominin  s started gradually changing their primate communication systems  acquiring the ability to form a   theory of mind theory of other minds   and a shared   intentionality    this development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume  and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions  language is processed in many different locations in the   human brain    but especially in   broca s area broca s   and   wernicke s area  s  humans   language acquisition acquire   language through social interaction in early childhood  and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old  the use of language is deeply entrenched in human   culture    therefore  in addition to its strictly communicative uses  language also has many social and cultural uses  such as signifying group   identity  social science  identity      social stratification    as well as for   social grooming   and   entertainment   languages   language change evolve   and diversify over time  and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by   historical linguistics comparing   modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later stages to have occurred  a group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a   language family    the languages that are most spoken in the world today belong to the   indo european languages indo european family    which includes languages such as   english language english      spanish language spanish      portuguese language portuguese      russian language russian    and   hindi language hindi    the   sino tibetan languages    which include   mandarin chinese      cantonese    and many others    semitic languages    which include   arabic language arabic      amharic    and   hebrew language hebrew     and the   bantu languages    which include   swahili language swahili      zulu language zulu      shona language shona    and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout   africa    the consensus is that between 50 and 90  of languages spoken today will probably have become extinct by the year 2100     definitions  the english word  language  derives ultimately from   indo european        tongue  speech  language  through   latin     lingua     language  tongue   and   old french     langage    language     the word is sometimes used to refer to   code  s    cipher  s  and other kinds of   constructed language artificially constructed communication systems   such as those used for   programming language computer programming    a language in this sense is a   system   of   sign  linguistics  signs   for   encoding   and decoding   information    this article specifically concerns the properties of   natural language natural human language   as it is studied in the discipline of   linguistics    as an object of linguistic study   language  has two primary meanings  an abstract concept  and a specific linguistic system  e g     french language french     the swiss linguist   ferdinand de saussure    who defined the modern discipline of linguistics  first explicitly formulated the distinction using the french word   langage   for language as a concept      langue and parole langue     as a specific instance of a language system  and   parole   for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language  when speaking of language as a general concept  definitions can be used which stress different aspects of the phenomenon   these definitions also entail different approaches and understandings of language  and they inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory     mental faculty  organ or instinct   one definition sees language primarily as the   mind mental faculty   that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour  to learn languages and to produce and understand utterances  this definition stresses the universality of language to all humans and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the   human brain    proponents of the view that the drive to language acquisition is innate in humans often argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction  languages may even spontaneously develop in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language  for example    creole languages   and spontaneously developed sign languages such as   nicaraguan sign language    this view  which can be traced back to   immanuel kant kant   and   rene descartes descartes    often understands language to be largely   innatism innate    for example  in   noam chomsky chomsky s   theory of   universal grammar    or american philosopher   jerry fodor   s extreme innatist theory  these kinds of definitions are often applied by studies of language within a   cognitive science   framework and in   neurolinguistics        formal symbolic system   another definition sees language as a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning  this definition stresses that human languages can be described as closed   structural linguistics structural system  s consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings this   structuralism structuralist   view of language was first introduced by   ferdinand de saussure     and his structuralism remains foundational for most approaches to language today   some proponents of this view of language have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements and then by formulating a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences  the main proponent of such a theory is   noam chomsky    the originator of the   generative linguistics generative theory of grammar    who has defined language as a particular set of sentences that can be generated from a particular set of rules chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature of the human mind and to constitute the essence of what language is   formal definitions of language are commonly used in   formal logic    in   formal grammar formal     theoretical linguistics theories of grammar    and in applied   computational linguistics        tool for communication       yet another definition sees language as a system of communication that enables humans to cooperate  this definition stresses the social functions of language and the fact that humans use it to express themselves and to manipulate objects in their environment    functional theories of grammar   explain grammatical structures by their communicative functions  and understand the grammatical structures of language to be the result of an adaptive process by which grammar was  tailored  to serve the communicative needs of its users   this view of language is associated with the study of language in   pragmatics pragmatic      cognitive linguistics cognitive    and interactive frameworks  as well as in   socio linguistics   and   linguistic anthropology    functionalist theories tend to study grammar as dynamic phenomena  as structures that are always in the process of changing as they are employed by their speakers  this view places importance on the study of   linguistic typology    or the classification of languages according to structural features  as it can be shown that processes of   grammaticalization   tend to follow trajectories that are partly dependent on typology  in the philosophy of language  these views are often associated with   ludwig wittgenstein wittgenstein s   later works and with ordinary language philosophers such as   paul grice      john searle   and   j  l  austin      in contrast  human language is open ended and   productivity  linguistics  productive    meaning that it allows humans to produce an infinite set of utterances from a finite set of elements and to create new words and sentences  this is possible because human language is based on a dual code  where a finite number of meaningless elements  e g  sounds  letters or gestures  can be combined to form units of meaning  words and sentences    furthermore  the symbols and grammatical rules of any particular language are largely arbitrary  meaning that the system can only be acquired through social interaction   the known systems of communication used by animals  on the other hand  can only express a finite number of utterances that are mostly genetically transmitted   several species of animals have proven able to acquire forms of communication through social learning  such as the   bonobo     kanzi    which learned to express itself using a set of symbolic   lexigram  s  similarly  many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species  however  while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols   none have been able to learn as many different signs as is generally known by an average 4 year old human  nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language  human languages also differ from animal communication systems in that they employ   grammatical categories grammatical and semantic categories    such as noun and verb  present and past  to express exceedingly complex meanings   human language is also the only known natural communication system that is   modality independent    meaning that it can be used not only for communication through one channel or medium  but through several   for example  spoken language uses the auditive modality  whereas   sign language  s and writing use the visual modality  and   braille   writing uses the tactile modality  with regard to the meaning that it may convey and the cognitive operations that it builds on  human language is also unique in being able to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in the past or may happen in the future  this ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called     displacement  linguistics  displacement      and while some animal communication systems  can use displacement  such as the communication of   bee  s that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight   the degree to which it is used in human language is also considered unique   currently  the only prominent proponent of a discontinuity based theory of human language origins is linguist and philosopher   noam chomsky    chomsky proposes that  some random mutation took place  maybe after some strange cosmic ray shower  and it reorganized the brain  implanting a language organ in an otherwise primate brain  while cautioning against taking this story too literally  chomsky insists that  it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes  including language  continuity based theories are currently held by a majority of scholars  but they vary in how they envision this development  those who see language as being mostly innate  for example  psychologist   steven pinker    hold the precedents to be   animal cognition       subdisciplines   the academic study of language is conducted within many different disciplinary areas and from different theoretical angles  all of which inform modern approaches to linguistics  for example    descriptive linguistics   examines the grammar of single languages    theoretical linguistics   develops theories on how best to conceptualize and define the nature of language based on data from the various extant human languages    sociolinguistics   studies how languages are used for social purposes informing in turn the study of the social functions of language and grammatical description    neurolinguistics   studies how language is processed in the human brain and allows the experimental testing of theories    computational linguistics   builds on theoretical and descriptive linguistics to construct computational models of language often aimed at processing natural language or at testing linguistic hypotheses  and   historical linguistics   relies on grammatical and lexical descriptions of languages to trace their individual histories and reconstruct trees of language families by using the   comparative method       early history   the formal study of language is often considered to have started in   india   with   p  ini    the 5th century bc grammarian who formulated 3 959 rules of   sanskrit language sanskrit     morphology  linguistics  morphology    however    sumer  ian scribes already studied the differences between   sumerian language sumerian   and   akkadian language akkadian   grammar around 1900 bc  subsequent grammatical traditions developed in all of the ancient cultures that adopted writing   in the 17th century ad  the french   port royal grammar  ians developed the idea that the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics of thought  and therefore that grammar was universal  in the 18th century  the first use of the   comparative method   by british   philologist   and expert on ancient india   william jones  philologist  william jones   sparked the rise of   comparative linguistics     the scientific study of language was broadened from indo european to language in general by   wilhelm von humboldt    early in the 20th century    ferdinand de saussure   introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units  defined through the oppositions between them     contemporary linguistics   in the 1960s    noam chomsky   formulated the   generative linguistics generative theory of language    according to this theory  the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages  this set of rules is called   universal grammar    for chomsky  describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics  thus  he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated  in opposition to the formal theories of the generative school    functional theories of grammar functional theories of language   propose that since language is fundamentally a tool  its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions    formal grammar formal theories of grammar   seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations  while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out   the framework of   cognitive linguistics   interprets language in terms of the concepts  which are sometimes universal  and sometimes specific to a particular language  which underlie its forms   cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language   physiological and neural architecture of language and speech  speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures  the production of spoken language depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips  tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus  the ability to acoustically decode speech sounds  and the neurological apparatus required for acquiring and producing language   the study of the genetic bases for human language is still on a fairly basic level  and the only gene that has been positively implied in language production is   foxp2    which may cause a kind of   developmental dyspraxia congenital language disorder   if affected by   mutation  s     the brain and language     is represented in orange    supramarginal gyrus   is represented in yellow    broca s area   is represented in blue    wernicke s area   is represented in green  and the   primary auditory cortex   is represented in pink     the brain is the coordinating center of all linguistic activity  it controls both the production of linguistic cognition and of meaning and the mechanics of speech production  nonetheless  our knowledge of the neurological bases for language is quite limited  though it has advanced considerably with the use of modern imaging techniques  the discipline of linguistics dedicated to studying the neurological aspects of language is called   neurolinguistics    early work in neurolinguistics involved the study of language in people with brain lesions  to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech  in this way  neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing  the first area is   wernicke s area    which is located in the posterior section of the   superior temporal gyrus   in the dominant cerebral hemisphere  people with a lesion in this area of the brain develop   receptive aphasia    a condition in which there is a major impairment of language comprehension  while speech retains a natural sounding rhythm and a relatively normal   syntax sentence structure    the second area is   broca s area    located in the posterior   inferior frontal gyrus   of the dominant hemisphere  people with a lesion to this area develop   expressive aphasia    meaning that they know  what they want to say  they just cannot get it out    they are typically able to understand what is being said to them  but unable to speak fluently  other symptoms that may be present in broca s aphasia include problems with fluency  articulation  word finding    word repetition    and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences  both orally and in writing  those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning of sentences  both broca s and wenicke s aphasia also affect the use of sign language  in analogous ways to how they affect speech  with broca s aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar  whereas a signer with wernicke s aphasia will sign fluently  but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others  signs  this shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language  not to the physiology used for speech production    with technological advances in the late 20th century  neurolinguists have also adopted non invasive techniques such as   functional magnetic resonance imaging    fmri  and   electrophysiology   to study language processing in individuals without impairments  the sound of speech can be analyzed into a combination of   segment  linguistics  segmental and suprasegmental   elements  the segmental elements are those that follow each other in sequences  which are usually represented by distinct letters in alphabetic scripts  such as the roman script  in free flowing speech  there are no clear boundaries between one segment and the next  nor usually are there any audible pauses between words  segments therefore are distinguished by their distinct sounds which are a result of their different articulations  and they can be either vowels or consonants  suprasegmental phenomena encompass such elements as   stress  linguistics  stress      phonation   type  voice   timbre    and   prosody  linguistics  prosody   or   intonation  linguistics  intonation    all of which may have effects across multiple segments     consonant  s and   vowel   segments combine to form   syllable  s  which in turn combine to form utterances  these can be distinguished phonetically as the space between two inhalations    acoustics acoustically    these different segments are characterized by different   formant   structures  that are visible in a   spectrogram   of the recorded sound wave  see illustration of spectrogram of the formant structures of three english vowels   formants are the amplitude peaks in the frequency spectrum of a specific sound  vowels are those sounds that have no audible friction caused by the narrowing or obstruction of some part of the upper vocal tract  they vary in quality according to the degree of lip aperture and the placement of the tongue within the oral cavity  consonants are those sounds that have audible friction or closure at some point within the upper vocal tract  consonant sounds vary by place of articulation  i e  the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed  commonly at the lips  teeth    alveolar ridge        palate          soft palate velum          uvula      or     glottis      each place of articulation produces a different set of consonant sounds  which are further distinguished by   manner of articulation    or the kind of friction  whether full closure  in which case the consonant is called     occlusive     or     stop consonant stop      or different degrees of aperture creating     fricative  s   and     approximant consonant approximants      consonants can also be either     voice  phonetics  voiced or unvoiced      depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound  voicing is what separates english in   bus      sibilant unvoiced sibilant    from in   buzz      voiced_alveolar_sibilant voiced_alveolar_sibilant voiced sibilant     some speech sounds  both vowels and consonants  involve release of air flow through the nasal cavity  and these are called     nasal consonant nasals     or     nasalization nasalized     sounds  other sounds are defined by the way the tongue moves within the mouth  such as the l sounds  called     lateral consonant lateral  s    because the air flows along both sides of the tongue   and the r sounds  called     rhotics      that are characterized by how the tongue is positioned relative to the air stream    structure  when described as a system of   symbolic communication    language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts    sign  semiotics  sign  s    meaning  semiotics  meaning  s  and a   code  semiotics  code   connecting signs with their meanings  the study of the process of   semiosis    how signs and meanings are combined  used  and interpreted is called   semiotics    signs can be composed of sounds  gestures  letters  or symbols  depending on whether the language is spoken  signed  or written  and they can be combined into complex signs  such as words and phrases  when used in communication  a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it    inscription at   thanjavur    some of the properties that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign  meaning that there is no predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning  the duality of the linguistic system  meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered  e g  how sounds build words and words build phrases  the discreteness of the elements of language  meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units  e g  sounds and words  that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns  and the productivity of the linguistic system  meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations   the division of language into separate but connected systems of sign and meaning goes back to the first linguistic studies of de saussure and is now used in almost all branches of linguistics     semantics   languages express meaning by relating a sign form to a meaning  or its content  sign forms must be something that can be perceived  for example  in sounds  images  or gestures  and then related to a specific meaning by social convention  because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention  linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary  in the sense that the convention is established socially and historically  rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning  thus  languages must have a   vocabulary   of signs related to specific meaning  the english sign  dog  denotes  for example  a member of the species     canis familiaris      in a language  the array of arbitrary signs connected to specific meanings is called the   lexicon    and a single sign connected to a meaning is called a   lexeme    not all meanings in a language are represented by single words  often  semantic concepts are embedded in the morphology or syntax of the language in the form of   grammatical category grammatical categories    all languages contain the semantic structure of   predicate  grammar  predication    a structure that predicates a property  state  or action  traditionally  semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign   truth value  s to statements  so that meaning is understood to be the process by which a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity  e g    nowiki  x  is y    or   x  does y    nowiki    recently  this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning  such models of meaning are explored in the field of   pragmatics     the study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called   phonetics     in spoken language  meaning is produced when sounds become part of a system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not  in any given language  only a limited number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning  sounds as part of a linguistic system are called   phonemes     phonemes are abstract units of sound  defined as the smallest units in a language that can serve to distinguish between the meaning of a pair of minimally different words  a so called   minimal pair    in english  for example  the words    bat    and    pat    form a minimal pair  in which the distinction between  b  and  p  differentiates the two words  which have different meanings  however  each language contrasts sounds in different ways  for example  in a language that does not distinguish between voiced and unvoiced consonants  the sounds  p  and  b  would be considered a single phoneme  and consequently  the two pronunciations would have the same meaning  similarly  the english language does not distinguish phonemically between   aspiration  linguistics  aspirated and non aspirated   pronunciations of consonants  as many other languages do  the unaspirated  p  in    spin    and the aspirated  p  in    pin    are considered to be merely different ways of pronouncing the same phoneme  such variants of a single phoneme are called   allophones     whereas in   mandarin chinese    the same difference in pronunciation distinguishes between the words  crouch  and  eight   the accent above the   means that the vowel is pronounced with a high tone    some languages have only a few phonemes  for example    rotokas language rotokas   and   pirah  language   with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively  whereas languages like   taa_language phonology taa   may have as many as 141 phonemes   in   sign language  s    phoneme phonemes_in_sign_languages the equivalent to phonemes    formerly called   chereme  s  are defined by the basic elements of gestures  such as hand shape  orientation  location  and motion  which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language    writing system  s represent language using visual symbols  which may or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language  the   latin alphabet    and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it  was originally based on the representation of single sounds  so that words were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word  in syllabic scripts  such as the   inuktitut   syllabary  each sign represents a whole syllable  in   logographic   scripts  each sign represents an entire word   and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language  because all languages have a very large number of words  no purely logographic scripts are known to exist  written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction  the direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention  some writing systems use the horizontal axis  left to right as the latin script or right to left as the   arabic script     while others such as traditional chinese writing use the vertical dimension  from top to bottom   a few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines  and others  such as the ancient maya script  can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading  in order to represent the sounds of the world s languages in writing  linguists have developed the   international phonetic alphabet    designed to represent all of the discrete sounds that are known to contribute to meaning in human languages     grammar   grammar is the study of how meaningful elements called     morphemes     within a language can be combined into utterances  morphemes can either be   free   or   bound    if they are free to be moved around within an utterance  they are usually called     words      and if they are bound to other words or morphemes  they are called   affix  es  the way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules  the rules for the internal structure of words are called   morphology  linguistics  morphology    the rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called   syntax        grammatical categories    grammar can be described as a system of categories and a set of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning   languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units  however  several categories are so common as to be nearly universal  such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically   morphosyntactic alignment distinguishing between their relations   to a predicate  the encoding of   grammatical tense temporal   and   preposition and postposition spatial   relations on predicates  and a system of   grammatical person   governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking      word classes    languages organize their   parts of speech   into classes according to their functions and positions relative to other parts  all languages  for instance  make a basic distinction between a group of words that prototypically denotes things and concepts and a group of words that prototypically denotes actions and events  the first group  which includes english words such as  dog  and  song   are usually called   noun  s  the second  which includes  run  and  sing   are called   verb  s  another common category is the   adjective    words that describe properties or qualities of nouns  such as  red  or  big   word classes can be  open  if new words can continuously be added to the class  or relatively  closed  if there is a fixed number of words in a class  in english  the class of pronouns is closed  whereas the class of adjectives is open  since infinite numbers of adjectives can be constructed from verbs  e g   saddened   or nouns  e g  with the  like suffix  noun like    in other languages such as   korean language korean    the situation is the opposite  and new pronouns can be constructed  whereas the number of adjectives is fixed  the word classes also carry out differing functions in grammar  prototypically  verbs are used to construct   predicate  grammar  predicate  s  while nouns are used as   argument  s of predicates  in a sentence such as  sally runs   the predicate is  runs   because it is the word that predicates a specific state about its argument  sally   some verbs such as  curse  can take two arguments  e g   sally cursed john   a predicate that can only take a single argument is called   transitivity  grammar    intransitive      while a predicate that can take two arguments is called   transitive verb   transitive      many other word classes exist in different languages  such as   conjunction  grammar  conjunction  s that serve to join two sentences    article  grammar  articles   that introduce a noun    interjections   such as  agh   or  wow    or   ideophones   that mimic the sound of some event  some languages have positionals that describe the spatial position of an event or entity  many languages have   classifier  linguistics  classifier  s that identify countable nouns as belonging to a particular type or having a particular shape  for instance  in   japanese language japanese    the general noun classifier for humans is   nin        and it is used for counting humans  whatever they are called    san nin no gakusei           lit   3 human classifier of student    three studentsfor trees  it would be    san bon no ki          lit   3 classifier for long objects of tree    three trees    morphology    in linguistics  the study of the internal structure of complex words and the processes by which words are formed is called   morphology  linguistics  morphology    in most languages  it is possible to construct complex words that are built of several   morpheme  s  for instance  the english word  unexpected  can be analyzed as being composed of the three morphemes  un     expect  and   ed    morphemes can be classified according to whether they are independent morphemes  so called     root  linguistics  roots      or whether they can only co occur attached to other morphemes  these bound morphemes or     affix  es   can be classified according to their position in relation to the root      prefix  es   precede the root      suffix  es   follow the root  and     infix  es   are inserted in the middle of a root  affixes serve to modify or elaborate the meaning of the root  some languages change the meaning of words by changing the phonological structure of a word  for example  the english word  run   which in the past tense is  ran   this process is called     ablaut      furthermore  morphology distinguishes between the process of     inflection      which modifies or elaborates on a word  and the process of     derivation  linguistics  derivation      which creates a new word from an existing one  in english  the verb  sing  has the inflectional forms  singing  and  sung   which are both verbs  and the derivational form  singer   which is a noun derived from the verb with the agentive suffix   er     languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation  in some languages  for example  chinese  there are no morphological processes  and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words  this type of morpho syntax is often called   isolating language isolating    or analytic  because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning  most languages have words consisting of several morphemes  but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units  in many languages  notably in most indo european languages  single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments  for example  in latin  the word   bonus    or  good   consists of the root   bon     meaning  good   and the suffix    us    which indicates masculine gender  singular number  and   nominative   case  these languages are called     fusional languages      because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme  the opposite type of fusional languages are   agglutinative languages    which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains  but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit  an example of such a language is   turkish language turkish    where for example  the word   evlerinizden    or  from your houses   consists of the morphemes    ev ler iniz den    with the meanings   house plural your from    the languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called   polysynthetic languages    they may express the equivalent of an entire english sentence in a single word  for example  in the   yupik language yupik   word   tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq    which means  he had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer   the word consists of the morphemes   tuntu ssur qatar ni ksaite ngqiggte uq   with the meanings   reindeer hunt future say negation again third person singular indicative   and except for the morpheme   tuntu    or  reindeer   none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation   many languages use morphology to cross reference words within a sentence  this is sometimes called     agreement  linguistics  agreement      for example  in many indo european languages  adjectives must cross reference the noun they modify in terms of number  case  and gender  so that the latin adjective   bonus    or  good   is inflected to agree with a noun that is masculine gender and singular  in many polysynthetic languages  verbs cross reference their subjects and objects  in these types of languages  a single verb may include information that would require an entire sentence in english  for example  in the   basque language basque   phrase   ikusi nauzu    or  you saw me   the past tense auxiliary verb   n au zu    similar to english  do   agrees with both the subject  you  expressed by the   n    prefix  and with the object  me  expressed by the    zu   suffix  the sentence could be directly transliterated as  see you did me      syntax      of the phrase   on the  mat  is a   locative  case  locative   phrase  and  sat  is the core of the   predicate  grammar  predicate     another way in which languages convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence  the grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax  the syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in english such as  i love you  is meaningful  but   love you i  is not   syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained  and how those constraints contribute to meaning   for example  in english  the two sentences  the slaves were cursing the master  and  the master was cursing the slaves  mean different things  because the role of the grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb  and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb  conversely  in   latin language latin    both   dominus servos vituperabat   and   servos vituperabat dominus   mean  the master was reprimanding the slaves   because   servos    or  slaves   is in the   accusative case    showing that they are the   object  grammar  grammatical object   of the sentence  and   dominus    or  master   is in the   nominative case    showing that he is the subject  latin uses morphology to express the distinction between subject and object  whereas english uses word order  another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of   wh movement inverse word order in questions    which exists in many languages  this rule explains why when in english  the phrase  john is talking to lucy  is turned into a question  it becomes  who is john talking to    and not  john is talking to who    the latter example may be used as a way of placing   focus  linguistics  special emphasis   on  who   thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question  syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units  called   phrase  s  that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure  sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure  connecting the phrases to each other at different levels to the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the english sentence  the cat sat on the mat   the sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase  a verb  and a prepositional phrase  the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase  and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun  the reason sentences can be seen as being composed of phrases is because each phrase would be moved around as a single element if syntactic operations were carried out  for example   the cat  is one phrase  and  on the mat  is another  because they would be treated as single units if a decision was made to emphasize the location by moving forward the prepositional phrase    and  on the mat  the cat sat   for example  languages can be classified on the basis of their basic   word order    the relative order of the   verb    and its constituents in a normal indicative   sentence  linguistics  sentence    in english  the basic order is   subject verb object svo     the snake s  bit v  the man o    whereas for example  the corresponding sentence in the   australian aboriginal languages australian language     gamilaraay language gamilaraay   would be   d uyugu n ama  d ayn yi y    snake man bit     subject object verb sov     word order type is relevant as a typological parameter  because basic word order type corresponds with other syntactic parameters  such as the relative order of nouns and adjectives  or of the use of   prepositions   or   postpositions    such correlations are called   linguistic universals implicational universal  s  for example  most  but not all  languages that are of the   subject object verb sov   type have postpositions rather than prepositions  and have adjectives before nouns   through the study of various types of word order  it has been discovered that not all languages group the relations between actors and actions into subject  object and verb  as english does  this type is called the   nominative absolutive language nominative accusative   type  some languages called   ergativity ergative    gamilaraay among them  distinguish between agents and patients  in english transitive clauses  both the subject of intransitive sentences   i run   and transitive sentences   i love you   are treated in the same way  shown here by the nominative pronoun   i    in ergative languages  the single participant in an intransitive sentence  such as  i run   is treated the same as the patient in a transitive sentence  giving the equivalent of  me run  and  you love me   only in transitive sentences would the equivalent of the pronoun  i  be used  the shared features of languages which belong to the same typological class type may have arisen completely independently  their co occurrence might be due to the universal laws governing the structure of natural languages   language universals   or they might be the result of languages evolving convergent solutions to the recurring communicative problems that humans use language to solve   due to the way in which language is transmitted between generations and within communities  language perpetually changes  diversifying into new languages or converging due to   language contact    the process is similar to the process of   evolution    where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a   phylogenetic tree     however  languages differ from a biological organisms in that they readily incorporate elements from other languages through the process of   diffusion    as speakers of different languages come into contact  humans also frequently speak more than one language  acquiring their   first language   or languages as children  or learning new languages as they grow up  because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world  many small languages are becoming   endangered language endangered   as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities     usage and meaning   the semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is located in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention  however  semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language  rather  when studying the way in which words and signs are used  it is often the case that words have different meanings  depending on the social context of use  an important example of this is the process called   deixis    which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered  such words are  for example  the word   i   which designates the person speaking    now   which designates the moment of speaking   and  here   which designates the time of speaking   signs also change their meanings over time  as the conventions governing their usage gradually change  the study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics  deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world   pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning  for example  in all languages  linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information  but to perform actions  certain actions are made only through language  but nonetheless have tangible effects  e g  the act of  naming   which creates a new name for some entity  or the act of  pronouncing someone man and wife   which creates a social contract of marriage  these types of acts are called   speech act  s  although they can of course also be carried out through writing or hand signing   the form of linguistic expression often does not correspond to the meaning that it actually has in a social context  for example  if at a dinner table a person asks   can you reach the salt    that is  in fact  not a question about the length of the arms of the one being addressed  but a request to pass the salt across the table  this meaning is implied by the context in which it is spoken  these kinds of effects of meaning are called   conversational implicature  s  these social rules for which ways of using language are considered appropriate in certain situations and how utterances are to be understood in relation to their context vary between communities  and learning them is a large part of acquiring   communicative competence   in a language     language acquisition    all healthy    human development  biology  normally developing   human beings learn to use language  children acquire the language or languages used around them  whichever languages they receive sufficient exposure to during childhood  the development is essentially the same for children acquiring   sign language sign   or   oral language  s   this learning process is referred to as first language acquisition  since unlike many other kinds of learning  it requires no direct teaching or specialized study  in     the descent of man  and selection in relation to sex the descent of man      naturalist   charles darwin   called this process  an instinctive tendency to acquire an art   acquisition of second and additional languages can come at any age  through exposure in daily life or courses  children learning a second language are more likely to achieve native like fluency than adults  but in general  it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker  an important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows    language and culture        the conversation    circa 1935   languages  understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community  are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speaks them  languages do not differ only in pronunciation  vocabulary  or grammar  but also through having different  cultures of speaking   humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group and difference from others  even among speakers of one language  several different ways of using the language exist  and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture  linguists and anthropologists  particularly   sociolinguistics sociolinguists      anthropological linguistics ethnolinguists    and   linguistic anthropology linguistic anthropologists   have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between   speech community speech communities    linguists use the term    variety  linguistics  varieties    to refer to the different ways of speaking a language  this term includes geographically or socioculturally defined   dialect  s as well as the   register  sociolinguistics  jargons   or   style shifting styles   of   subculture  s  linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture  because norms for language use are shared by members of a specific group  communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity  linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups  for example  speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class  one s area of origin  or status as a second language speaker  these kinds of differences are not part of the linguistic system  but are an important part of how language users use language as a social tool for constructing groups  however  many languages also have grammatical conventions that signal the social position of the speaker in relation to others through the use of registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions  in many languages  there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak  between age groups  or between   social class  es  just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening  for example  in the australian language   dyirbal language dyirbal    a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother in law   in english  social deixis is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname  and also in titles such as  mrs     boy    doctor   or  your honor   but in other languages  such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language  for instance  in several languages of east asia  such as   thai language thai      burmese language burmese    and   old javanese javanese    different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest   the invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the   bronze age   in the late   neolithic   period of the late   4th millennium bc    the   sumerian language sumerian   archaic   cuneiform  script  cuneiform script   and the   egyptian hieroglyphs   are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems  both emerging out of their ancestral proto literate symbol systems from 3400 3200 bc with the earliest coherent texts from about   26th century bc 2600 bc     it is generally agreed that sumerian writing was an independent invention  however  it is debated whether egyptian writing was developed completely independently of sumerian  or was a case of   cultural diffusion    a similar debate exists for the   chinese script    which developed around   1200 bc    the   pre columbian     mesoamerican writing systems    including among others   olmec   and   maya script  s  are generally believed to have had independent origins   changes may affect specific sounds or the entire   phonological change phonological system      sound change   can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or   distinctive feature phonetic feature   by another  the complete loss of the affected sound  or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there previously was none  sound changes can be   conditioned   in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds   sound change is usually assumed to be   regular    which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met  irrespective of any non phonological factors  on the other hand  sound changes can sometimes be   sporadic    affecting only one particular word or a few words  without any seeming regularity  sometimes a simple change triggers a   chain shift   in which the entire phonological system is affected  this happened in the   germanic languages   when the sound change known as   grimm s law   affected all the stop consonants in the system  the original consonant  became  b  in the germanic languages  the previous  in turn became  p   and the previous  became  f   the same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why   italic languages   such as latin have   p   in words like      p   ater   and      p   isces    whereas germanic languages  like english  have      f   ather   and      f   ish     another example is the   great vowel shift   in english  which is the reason that the spelling of english vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation  this is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation  another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words  leaving out syllables or sounds  this kind of change caused latin   mea domina   to eventually become the   french language french     madame   and american english   ma am    change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as   idiom  s or particular constructions become   grammaticalized    this frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element  for example  in some varieties of   caribbean spanish   the final  s  has eroded away  since   standard spanish   uses final  s  in the morpheme marking the   grammatical person second person   subject  you  in verbs  the caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun   t     this means that the sentence  what s your name  is    como te llamas    in standard spanish  but in caribbean spanish  the simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax   another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms  for example  the way the english  going to  construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of english has almost become a full fledged future tense  e g    i m gonna    language change may be motivated by  language internal  factors  such as changes in pronunciation motivated by certain sounds being difficult to distinguish aurally or to produce  or because of certain patterns of change that cause certain rare types of constructions to   drift  linguistics  drift   towards more common types   other causes of language change are social  such as when certain pronunciations become emblematic of membership in certain groups  such as social classes  or with   language ideology ideologies    and therefore are adopted by those who wish to identify with those groups or ideas  in this way  issues of identity and politics can have profound effects on language structure     language contact   one important source of language change is contact between different languages and resulting   trans cultural diffusion diffusion   of linguistic traits between languages  language contact occurs when speakers of two or more   languages   or   variety  linguistics  varieties   interact on a regular basis     multilingualism   is likely to have been the norm throughout   human history    and today  most people in the world are multilingual  before the rise of the concept of the   nation state ethno national state    monolingualism was characteristic mainly of populations inhabiting small islands  but with the ideology that made one people  one state  and one language the most desirable political arrangement  monolingualism started to spread throughout the world  nonetheless  there are only 250 countries in the world corresponding to some 6000 languages  which means that most countries are multilingual and most languages therefore exist in close contact with other languages  when speakers of different languages interact closely  it is typical for their languages to influence each other  through sustained language contact over long periods  linguistic traits diffuse between languages  and languages belonging to different families may converge to become more similar  in areas where many languages are in close contact  this may lead to the formation of   sprachbund language areas   in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features  a number of such language areas have been documented  among them  the   balkan language area    the   mesoamerican language area    and the   ethiopian language area    also  larger areas such as   south asia    europe  and southeast asia have sometimes been considered language areas  because of widespread diffusion of specific   areal feature  linguistics  areal feature  s   language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena  including   language convergence      loanword borrowing    and   relexification    replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language   in situations of extreme and sustained language contact  it may lead to the formation of new   mixed language  s that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family  one type of mixed language called   pidgins   occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis  but in a situation where neither group learns to learn to speak the language of the other group fluently  in such a case  they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages  but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure  the language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages  pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers  but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language  but if a pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community  then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language  as the generation of child learners grow up  the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity  this type of language is generally called a   creole language    an example of such mixed languages is   tok pisin    the official language of   papua new guinea    which originally arose as a pidgin based on english and   austronesian languages    others are   haitian creole krey l ayisyen    the french based creole language spoken in   haiti    and

is in wide use as a primary form of communication by a specific group of living people  the exact number of known living languages varies from 6 000 to 7 000  depending on the precision of one s definition of  language   and in particular  on how one defines the distinction between languages and   dialects     as of 2009    sil ethnologue   cataloged 6909 living human languages  the ethnologue establishes linguistic groups based on studies of   mutual intelligibility    and therefore often include more categories than more conservative classifications  for example  the   danish language   that most scholars consider a single language with several dialects is classified as two distinct languages  danish and   jutlandic dialect jutish    by the ethnologue     languages and dialects   there is no   dialect  22dialect 22 or  22language 22 clear distinction   between a language and a   dialect    notwithstanding a famous   aphorism   attributed to linguist   max weinreich   that    a language is a dialect with an army and navy       for example  national boundaries frequently override linguistic difference in determining whether two linguistic varieties are languages or dialects    cantonese language cantonese   and   mandarin language mandarin   are  for example  often classified as  dialects  of chinese  even though they are more different from each other than   swedish language swedish   is from   norwegian language norwegian    before the   yugoslav civil war      serbo croatian language serbo croatian   was considered a single language with two dialects  but now   croatian language croatian   and   serbian language serbian   are considered different languages and employ different writing systems  in other words  the distinction may hinge on political considerations as much as on cultural differences  distinctive   writing system  s  or degree of   mutual intelligibility        language families of the world          the world s languages can be grouped into   language family language families   consisting of languages that can be shown to have common ancestry  linguists currently recognize many hundreds of language families  although some of them can possibly be grouped into larger units as more evidence becomes available and in depth studies are carried out  at present  there are also dozens of   language isolate  s  languages that cannot be shown to be related to any other languages in the world  among them is   basque language basque    spoken in europe    zuni language zuni   of   new mexico      pur pecha language p urh pecha   of mexico    ainu language ainu   of japan    burushaski language burushaski   of   pakistan    and many others the language families of the world that have most speakers are the   indo european languages    spoken by 46  of the world s population  this family includes major world languages like   english language english      spanish language spanish      russian language russian    and   hindustani language hindustani      hindi     urdu     the indo european family achieved prevalence first during the   eurasia  n   migration period    c  400 800 ad   and subsequently through the   history of colonialism european colonial expansion    which brought the indo european languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the   americas   and much of   africa    the   sino tibetan languages   are spoken by 21  of the world s population and include many of the languages of east asia  including   mandarin chinese      cantonese language cantonese    and hundreds of smaller languages   africa   is home to a large number of language families  the largest of which is the   niger congo languages niger congo language family    which includes such languages as   swahili language swahili      shona language shona    and   yoruba language yoruba    speakers of the niger congo languages account for 6 4  of the world s population   a similar number of people speak the   afroasiatic languages    which include the populous   semitic languages   such as   arabic language arabic      hebrew language    and the languages of the   sahara   region  such as the   berber languages   and   hausa language hausa   the   austronesian languages   are spoken by 5 9  of the world s population and stretch from   madagascar   to   maritime southeast asia   all the way to   oceania    it includes such languages as   malagasy language malagasy      maori language m ori      samoan language samoan    and many of the indigenous languages of   indonesia   and   formosan languages taiwan    the austronesian languages are considered to have originated in taiwan around 3000 bc and spread through the oceanic region through island hopping  based on an advanced nautical technology  other populous language families are the   dravidian languages   of   south asia    among them   tamil language tamil   and   telugu language telugu     the   turkic languages   of central asia  such as   turkish language turkish     the   austroasiatic languages austroasiatic    among them   khmer language khmer     and   tai kadai languages   of   southeast asia    including   thai language thai     the areas of the world in which there is the greatest linguistic diversity  such as the americas    papua new guinea      west africa    and south asia  contain hundreds of small language families  these areas together account for the majority of the world s languages  though not the majority of speakers  in the americas  some of the largest language families include the   quechumaran languages quechumaran      arawak languages arawak    and   tupi guarani languages tupi guarani   families of south america  the   uto aztecan languages uto aztecan      oto manguean languages oto manguean    and   mayan languages mayan   of   mesoamerica    and the   na dene languages na dene   and   algonquian languages algonquian   language families of   north america    in australia  most indigenous languages belong to the   pama nyungan languages pama nyungan family    whereas papua new guinea is home to a large number of small families and isolates  as well as a number of austronesian languages   but this belief is contradicted by the fact that many of the world s major episodes of violence have taken place in situations with low linguistic diversity  such as the   yugoslav wars yugoslav   and   american civil war  s  or the genocides of   nazi germany   and   rwanda    whereas many of the most stable political units have been highly multilingual   many projects underway are aimed at preventing or slowing this loss by   language revitalization revitalizing   endangered languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages  across the world  many countries have enacted   language policy specific legislation   aimed at protecting and stabilizing the language of indigenous   speech community speech communities    a minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process that should not be counteracted  and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient    see also   lists     category

period    art came to be seen as  a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science    though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed    and has changed over time  general descriptions mention an idea of   agency  philosophy  human agency    and creation through imaginative or technical skill  the nature of art  and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation  are explored in a branch of   philosophy   known as   aesthetics       creative art and fine art   by a broad definition of art   the first and broadest sense of   art   is the one that has remained closest to the older latin meaning  which roughly translates to  skill  or  craft   a few examples where this meaning proves very broad include   artifact      artificial      artifice        medicine medical   arts    and     military   arts    however  there are many other colloquial uses of the word  all with some relation to its   etymology    n bottle  artistic works may serve practical functions  in addition to their decorative value   in medieval philosophy    john chrysostom   held that  the name of art should be applied to those only which contribute towards and produce necessaries and mainstays of life     thomas aquinas    when treating the adornment of women  gives an   ethics ethical   justification as to why   in the case of an art directed to the production of goods which men cannot use without sin  it follows that the workmen sin in making such things  as directly affording others an occasion of sin  for instance  if a man were to make idols or anything pertaining to idolatrous worship  but in the case of an art the products of which may be employed by man either for a good or for an evil use  such as swords  arrows  and the like  the practice of such an art is not sinful  these alone should be called arts    aquinas held that art is nothing else than  the right reason about certain works to be made   and that it is commendable  not for the will with which a craftman does a work   but for the quality of the work  art  therefore  properly speaking  is an operative habit     aristotle   and aquinas distinguish it from the related habit of   prudence    the second and more recent sense of the word   art   is as an abbreviation for   creative art   or   fine art   and emerged in the early 17th century   fine art means that a skill is being used to express the artist s   creativity    or to engage the audience s aesthetic sensibilities  or to draw the audience towards consideration of the   finer   things the word   art   can refer to several things  a study of creative skill  a process of using the creative skill  a product of the creative skill  or the audience s experience with the creative skill  the creative arts    art   as discipline  are a collection of disciplines that produce   artworks      art   as objects  that are compelled by a personal drive  art as activity  and convey a message  mood  or symbolism for the viewer to interpret  art as experience    art is something that stimulates an individual s thoughts  emotions  beliefs  or ideas through the senses  artworks can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects  although the application of scientific knowledge to derive a new scientific theory involves skill and results in the  creation  of something new  this represents science only and is not categorized as art often  if the skill is being used in a common or practical way  people will consider it a craft instead of art  likewise  if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way  it may be considered   commercial art   instead of fine art  on the other hand  crafts and   design   are sometimes considered   applied art    some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference   however  even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self expression  the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas  such as in politically  spiritually  or philosophically motivated art  to create a sense of   beauty    see   aesthetics     to explore the nature of perception  for pleasure  or to generate strong   emotion  s  the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent the nature of art has been described by philosopher   richard wollheim   as  one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture    art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas  a means for exploring and appreciating   formalism  art  formal elements   for their own sake  and as     mimesis     or   representation  arts  representation    art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of   aristotle       leo tolstoy   identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another     benedetto croce   and   r g  collingwood   advanced the   idealism idealist   view that art expresses emotions  and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator    the theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of   immanuel kant    and was developed in the early twentieth century by   roger fry   and   clive bell     more recently  thinkers influenced by   martin heidegger   have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self expression and interpretation     george dickie   has offered an   institutional theory of art   that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as  the   art world    has conferred  the status of candidate for appreciation    larry shiner has described fine art as  not an essence or a fate but something we have made  art as we have generally understood it is a european invention barely two hundred years old

iran persia    india  china  ancient greece  rome  as well as   inca      maya civilization maya    and   olmec    each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art  because of the size and duration of these civilizations  more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times  some also have provided the first records of how artists worked  for example  this period of greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature  poise  beauty  and anatomically correct proportions in   byzantine art byzantine   and   medieval art   of the western middle ages  much art focused on the expression of biblical and religious truths  and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world  such as the use of gold in the background of paintings  or glass in mosaics or windows  which also presented figures in idealized  patterned  flat  forms  nevertheless a classical realist tradition persisted in small byzantine works  and realism steadily grew in the art of catholic europe   renaissance art   had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world  and the place of humans in it  reflected in the corporeality of the human body  and development of a systematic method of   graphical perspective   to depict recession in a three dimensional picture space     mahmud ii   of the   ottoman empire   was written in   arabic calligraphy    it reads   mahmud khan son of abdulhamid is forever victorious        also called the mosque of uqba  is one of the finest  most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques  dated in

kairouan   in   tunisia     in the east    islamic art   s rejection of   iconography   led to emphasis on geometric patterns    islamic calligraphy calligraphy    and   islamic architecture architecture    further east  religion dominated artistic styles and forms too  india and tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance  while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines  china saw the flourishing of many art forms  jade carving  bronzework  pottery  including the stunning   terracotta army   of emperor qin   poetry  calligraphy  music  painting  drama  fiction  etc  chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty  so  for example    tang dynasty   paintings are monochromatic and sparse  emphasizing idealized landscapes  but   ming dynasty   paintings are busy and colorful  and focus on telling stories via setting and composition  japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too  and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting    woodblock printing   became important in japan after the 17th century   artist ma lin    circa   1250  24 8 nbsp   25 2 nbsp cm  the western   age of enlightenment   in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe  as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post monarchist world  such as   william blake blake   s portrayal of newton as a divine geometer  or   jacques louis david david   s propagandistic paintings  this led to   romanticism romantic   rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans  exemplified in the novels of   goethe    the late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements  such as   academic art      symbolism  arts  symbolism      impressionism   and   fauvism   among others the history of twentieth century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards  each being torn down in succession by the next  thus the parameters of   impressionism      expressionism      fauvism      cubism      dadaism      surrealism    etc  cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention  increasing   globalization global   interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into western art  such as pablo picasso being influenced by   african art african sculpture    japanese woodblock prints  which had themselves been influenced by western renaissance draftsmanship  had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development  later  african sculptures were taken up by picasso and to some extent by   matisse    similarly  the west has had huge impacts on eastern art in the 19th and 20th centuries  with originally western ideas like   communism   and   post modernism   exerting a powerful influence on artistic styles modernism  the idealistic search for truth  gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability     theodor w  adorno   said in 1970   it is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more  neither art itself  nor art in relationship to the whole  nor even the right of art to exist      relativism   was accepted as an unavoidable truth  which led to the period of   contemporary art   and   list of postmodern critics postmodern criticism    where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms  which can be appreciated and drawn from only with irony  furthermore the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture  rather than regional cultures   forms  genres  media  and styles    s   mona lisa    showing the painting technique of     sfumato      the creative arts are often divided into more specific categories  each related to its technique  or   media  arts  medium    such as   decorative art  s    plastic arts      performing arts    or   literature    unlike scientific fields  art is one of the few subjects that are academically organized according to technique  http   www rchoetzlein com quanta theory theory new media htm  an artistic   recording medium medium   is the substance or material the artistic work is made from  and may also refer to the technique used  for example  paint is a medium used in painting  and paper is a medium used in drawing an      art form      is the specific   shape    or quality an artistic expression takes  the media used often influence the form  for example  the   shape form   of a sculpture must exist in space in three dimensions  and respond to gravity  the constraints and limitations of a particular medium are thus called its      formal qualities       to give another example  the formal qualities of painting are the canvas texture  color  and brush texture  the formal qualities of video games are non linearity  interactivity and virtual presence the   form   of a particular work of art is determined by the formal qualities of the media  and is not related to the intentions of the artist or the reactions of the audience in any way whatsoever as these properties are related to content rather than form  a      genre      is a set of conventions and styles within a particular medium  for instance  well recognized genres in film are   western  genre  western      horror  genre  horror   and   romantic comedy film romantic comedy    genres in music include   death metal   and   trip hop    genres in painting include   still life   and   landscape art pastoral landscape    a particular work of art may bend or combine genres but each genre has a recognizable group of conventions  clich s and tropes   one note  the word   genre   has a second older meaning within painting      genre painting     was a phrase used in the 17th to 19th centuries to refer specifically to paintings of scenes of everyday life and is still used in this way    by   hokusai    japanese  1760 1849   colored woodcut print

method and form followed by the respective art  any loose brushy  dripped or poured abstract painting is called   expressionistic    often a style is linked with a particular historical period  set of ideas  and particular artistic movement  so   jackson pollock   is called an   abstract expressionist   a particular style may have specific cultural meanings  for example    roy lichtenstein   a painter associated with the american   pop art   movement of the 1960s was not a   pointillism pointillist    despite his use of dots  lichtenstein used evenly spaced   ben day dots    the type used to reproduce color in comic strips  as a style to question the  high  art of painting with the  low  art of comics  thus commenting on class distinctions in culture  pointillism  a technique in late impressionism  1880s  developed especially by the artist   georges seurat    employs dots to create variation in color and depth in an attempt to approximate the way people really see color  both artists use dots  but the particular style and technique relate to the artistic movement adopted by each artist these are all ways of beginning to define a work of art  to narrow it down   imagine you are an art critic whose mission is to compare the meanings you find in a wide range of individual artworks  how would you proceed with your task  one way to begin is to examine the materials each artist selected in making an object  image video  or event  the decision to cast a sculpture in bronze  for instance  inevitably effects its meaning  the work becomes something different from how it might be if it had been cast in gold or plastic or chocolate  even if everything else about the artwork remains the same  next  you might examine how the materials in each artwork have become an arrangement of shapes  colors  textures  and lines  these  in turn  are organized into various patterns and compositional structures  in your interpretation  you would comment on how salient features of the form contribute to the overall meaning of the finished artwork   but in the end  the meaning of most artworks    is not exhausted by a discussion of materials  techniques  and form  most interpretations also include a discussion of the ideas and feelings the artwork engenders      skill and craft      detail from   michelangelo   s fresco in the     cappella sistina      1511   art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a   media  arts  medium    art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a   language   to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth  art is an act of expressing feelings  thoughts  and observations  there is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it  which facilitates one s thought processes a common view is that the   wikt epithet epithet    art   particular in its elevated sense  requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist  whether this be a demonstration of technical ability  an originality in stylistic approach  or a combination of these two  traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success  for   leonardo da vinci    art  neither more nor less than his other endeavors  was a manifestation of skill    rembrandt   s work  now praised for its ephemeral virtues  was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity  at the turn of the 20th century  the adroit performances of   john singer sargent   were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency  yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era s most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast    pablo picasso    was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled a common contemporary criticism of some   modern art   occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object  in conceptual art    marcel duchamp   s    fountain  duchamp  fountain    is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects   ready made   and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills    tracey emin   s   my bed    or   damien hirst   s   the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living   follow this example and also manipulate the   mass media    emin slept  and engaged in other activities  in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art  hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans  hirst s celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts  the actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects  however there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating   hands on   works of art    value judgment      australia  somewhat in relation to the above  the word   art   is also used to apply judgments of value  as in such expressions as  that meal was a work of art   the cook is an artist   or  the art of deception    the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised   it is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism  at the simplest level  a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered   art   is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive  though perception is always colored by experience  and is necessarily subjective  it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art  however   good  art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers  in other words  an artist s prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic  also  art often depicts terrible images made for social  moral  or thought provoking reasons  for example    francisco goya   s painting depicting the spanish shootings of   3rd of may 3rd nbsp of may   1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians  yet at the same time  the horrific imagery demonstrates goya s keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage  thus  the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction  if any  is required to define  art  the assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing  indeed  the reverse is often true  that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re invigoration of aesthetic sensibility  and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself  countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality  yet they all seem to agree in at least one point  once their aesthetic choices are accepted  the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the     zeitgeist     art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion  it can arouse   aesthetic   or   morality moral   feelings  and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings  artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent  but they do not have to do so consciously  art may be considered an exploration of the   human condition    that is  what it is to be human    purpose of art    made   circa   1880      commentary on the apocalypse beatus     miniature  illuminated manuscript  miniature    spain  late 10th century  art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history  making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept  this does not imply that the purpose of art is  vague   but that it has had many unique  different reasons for being created  some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline  the different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non motivated  and those that are motivated  levi strauss     non motivated functions of art   the non motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human  transcend the individual  or do not fulfill a specific external purpose  in this sense  art  as creativity  is something humans must do by their very nature  i e

but is often the result of many generations of change  and of a cosmological relationship within the culture  blockquote  most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative  ritual or symbolic  are aware of the trap posed by the term  art     silva tomaskova   blockquote    motivated functions of art   motivated purposes of art refer to intentional  conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator  these may be to bring about political change  to comment on an aspect of society  to convey a specific emotion or mood  to address personal psychology  to illustrate another discipline  to  with commercial arts  to sell a product  or simply as a form of communication     communication    art  at its simplest  is a form of communication  as most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual  this is a motivated purpose  illustrative arts  such as scientific illustration  are a form of art as communication  maps are another example  however  the content need not be scientific  emotions  moods and feelings are also communicated through art  blockquote   art is a set of  artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication    steve mithen   blockquote     art as entertainment

determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient  the end product is not the principal goal in this case  but rather a process of healing  through creative acts  is sought  the resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy     art for social inquiry  subversion and or anarchy    while similar to art for political change  subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal  in this case  the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society     graffiti   on a wall in rome     graffiti uses graffiti art   and other types of   street art   are

as graffiti  may also be illegal when they break laws  in this case vandalism      art for social causes    art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes  a number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of   autism         cancer         human trafficking      and a variety of other topics  such as ocean conservation   human rights in   darfur     murdered and missing aboriginal women   elder abuse   and   pollution       trashion    practiced by artists such as   marina debris   is one example of using art to raise awareness about pollution     art for propaganda  or commercialism    art is often utilized as a form of   propaganda    and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood  in a similar way  art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion  in both cases  the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object      art as a fitness indicator    it has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment  one   evolutionary psychology   explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits  such as artistic ability and creativity  are the human equivalent of the   peacock   s tail  the purpose of the male peacock s extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females  see also   fisherian runaway   and   handicap principle     according to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates  the functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive  as many of them may overlap  for example  art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product  i e  the movie or video game   public access    opened up the interior court to create the expansive entrance     cour d honneur      later copied all over europe   since ancient times  much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power  often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials  much art has been commissioned by rulers or religious establishments  with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society   nevertheless  there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available  in terms of ownership  across large parts of society  above all in cheap media such as pottery  which persists in the ground  and perishable media such as textiles and wood  in many different cultures  the   ceramics of indigenous peoples of the americas   are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a   social elite    though other forms of art may have been  reproductive methods such as   molding  process  moulds   made mass production easier  and were used to bring high quality   ancient roman pottery   and greek   tanagra figurine  s to a very wide market    cylinder seal  s were both artistic and practical  and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the   ancient near east    once   coin  s were widely used these also became an artform that reached the widest range of society   another important innovation came in the 15th century in europe  when   printmaking   began with small   woodcut  s  mostly religious  that were often very small and hand coloured  and affordable even by   peasant  s who glued them to the walls of their homes  printed books were initially very expensive  but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations     popular prints   of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries   public art public buildings and monuments    secular and religious  by their nature normally address the whole of society  and visitors as viewers  and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design    egyptian temple  s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public  rather than the areas seen only by the priests   many areas of royal palaces  castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible  and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen  either by anybody  or by those able to pay a small price  or those wearing the correct clothes  regardless of who they were  as at the   palace of versailles    where the appropriate extra accessories  silver shoe buckles and a sword  could be hired from shops outside special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries  as with the   orleans_collection collection_in_paris orleans collection   mostly housed in a wing of the   palais royal   in paris  which could be visited for most of the 18th century  in italy the art tourism of the   grand tour   became a major industry from the renaissance onwards  and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible   the british   royal collection   remains distinct  but large donations such as the   old royal library   were made from it to the   british museum    established in 1753   the   uffizi   in   florence   opened entirely as a gallery in 1765  though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants  offices for a long time before   the building now occupied by the   prado   in   madrid   was built before the french revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection  and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in   vienna      munich   and other capitals  the opening of the   mus e du louvre   during the   french revolution    in 1793  as a public museum for much of the former french royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art  transferring ownership to a republican state  but was a continuation of trends already well established most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone  museums in the united states tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses    the metropolitan museum of art   in new york city  for example  was created by   john taylor johnston    a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum   but despite all this  at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status    1978    everyone an artist   on the way to the libertarian form of the social organism    there have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object  one of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold  it is  necessary to present something more than mere objects   said the major post war german artist joseph beuys  this time period saw the rise of such things as   performance art      video art    and   conceptual art    the idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind  or was simply an idea  it could not be bought and sold   democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid 1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s  artists broadly identified under the heading of conceptual art    substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form     have  endeavored to undermine the art object qua object   in the decades since  these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition dvds of video works   invitations to exclusive performance art pieces  and the objects left over from conceptual pieces  many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art  the marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it  and the artwork remains an upper class activity   with the widespread use of dvd recording technology in the early 2000s  artists  and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks  gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors     controversies    s     the raft of the medusa raft of the medusa        circa   1820  art has long been controversial  that is to say disliked by some viewers  for a wide variety of reasons  though most pre modern controversies are dimly recorded  or completely lost to a modern view    iconoclasm   is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons  including religious ones    aniconism   is a general dislike of either all figurative images  or often just religious ones  and has been a thread in many major religions  it has been a crucial factor in the history of   islamic art    where   depictions of muhammad   remain especially controversial   much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers  parties or other groups  artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by   art critic  s  though often much less so by a wider public   the   iconography iconographic   content of art could cause controversy  as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the   swoon of the virgin   in scenes of the   crucifixion of jesus       the last judgment  michelangelo  the   last judgment     by   michelangelo   was controversial for various reasons  including breaches of   decorum   through nudity and the   apollo   like pose of christ the content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist  but with the advent of   romanticism    and econonomic changes in the production of art  the artists  vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art  increasing the incidence of controversies  though often reducing their significance   strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy    th odore g ricault   s     the raft of the medusa raft of the medusa      c  1820   was in part a political commentary on a recent event     douard manet   s     the luncheon on the grass le d jeuner sur l herbe      1863   was considered scandalous not because of the   nude   woman  but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time  rather than in robes of the antique world    john singer sargent   s     portrait of madame x madame pierre gautreau  madam nbsp x       1884   caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the woman s ear lobe  considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high society model s reputation the gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century   in the twentieth century    pablo picasso   s     guernica  painting  guernica      1937  used arresting   cubism cubist   techniques and stark   monochrome painting monochromatic oils    to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small  ancient basque town    leon golub   s   interrogation iii    1981   depicts a female nude  hooded detainee strapped to a chair  her legs open to reveal her sexual organs  surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing    andres serrano   s     piss christ      1989  is a photograph of a crucifix  sacred to the christian religion and representing   jesus christ christ   s sacrifice and final suffering  submerged in a glass of the artist s own urine  the resulting uproar led to comments in the united states senate about public funding of the arts   theory  in the nineteenth century  artists were primarily concerned with ideas of   truth   and     beauty      the aesthetic theorist   john ruskin    who championed what he saw as the naturalism of   j  m  w  turner j  nbsp m  nbsp w  turner    saw art s role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature  the definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century    richard wollheim   distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art  the   aesthetic realism realist    whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view  the   objectivity  philosophy  objectivist    whereby it is also an absolute value  but is dependent on general human experience  and the   relativist     aesthetic relativism position    whereby it is not an absolute value  but depends on  and varies with  the human experience of different humans  the arrival of   modernism   in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art   and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of   postmodern art postmodernism      clement greenberg   s 1960 article  modernist painting  defines modern art as  the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself    greenberg originally applied this idea to the abstract expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat  non illusionistic  abstract painting  after greenberg  several important art theorists emerged  such as   michael fried      t  j  clark  historian  t  nbsp j  nbsp clark      rosalind krauss      linda nochlin   and   griselda pollock   among others  though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists  greenberg s definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century   pop art  ists like   andy warhol   became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture  as well as the   art world    artists of the 1980s  1990s  and 2000s expanded this technique of self criticism beyond   high art   to all cultural image making  including fashion images  comics  billboards and pornography duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind  everything  however the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction   there is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this    the invention of art  a cultural history   is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i e    fine art    shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system  fine art  held art to be any skilled human activity i e  ancient greek society did not possess the term art but   techne    techne can be understood neither as art or craft  the reason being that the distinctions of art and   craft   are historical products that came later on in human history  techne included   painting      sculpting   and   music   but also    cooking      medicine      horsemanship      geometry      carpentry      prophecy   and   farming   etc   classification disputes    s     fountain  duchamp  fountain    1917  disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included   cubist   and   impressionist   paintings    duchamp   s     fountain  duchamp  fountain      the   movies    superlative imitations of   j  s  g  boggs banknotes      conceptual art    and   video games    philosopher david novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem  rather   the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life  are  so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art   novitz  1996   according to novitz  classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper  for example  when the   daily mail   criticized   damien hirst hirst   s and   tracey emin emin   s work by arguing  for 1 000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces  today  pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all  they are not advancing a definition or theory about art  but questioning the value of hirst s and emin s work   in 1998    arthur danto    suggested a thought experiment showing that  the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it  rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities  cultural interpretation  an art theory of some kind  is therefore constitutive of an object s arthood      anti art   is a label for art that intentionally

the term  europe  has developed gradually throughout history    in antiquity  the greek historian   herodotus   mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts  europe  asia  and libya  africa   with the   nile   and the   rioni river river phasis   forming their boundaries though he also states that some considered the   don river  russia  river don    rather than the phasis  as the boundary between europe and asia   europe s eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer   strabo   at the river don     flavius   and the     jubilees book of jubilees     described the continents as the lands given by   noah   to his three sons  europe was defined as stretching from the   pillars of hercules   at the   strait of gibraltar    separating it from   north africa    to the don  separating it from   asia    a cultural definition of europe as the lands of   christendom latin christendom   coalesced in the 8th century  signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of germanic traditions and christian latin culture  defined partly in contrast with   byzantium   and   islam    and limited to northern iberia  the british isles  france  christianized western germany  the alpine regions and northern and central italy   the concept is one of the lasting legacies of the   carolingian renaissance     europa  often figures in the letters of charlemagne s cultural minister    alcuin     this division as much cultural as geographical was used until the   late middle ages    when it was challenged by the   age of discovery     europe is now generally defined by geographers as the westernmost   peninsula   of eurasia  with its boundaries marked by large bodies of water to the north  west and south  europe s limits to the far east are usually taken to be the urals  the   ural river    and the   caspian sea    to the south east  including the   caucasus mountains    the   black sea   and the waterways connecting the black sea to the mediterranean sea   because of sociopolitical and cultural differences  there are various descriptions of europe s boundary  for example    cyprus   is approximate to   anatolia anatolia  or asia minor     but is usually considered part of europe both culturally and politically and currently is a member state of the eu  in addition    malta   was considered an island of north africa for centuries   while   iceland    though nearer to   greenland    north america   is also generally included in europe sometimes  the word  europe  is used in a geopolitically limiting way  to refer only to the european union or  even more exclusively  a culturally defined core  on the other hand  the   council of europe   has 47 member countries  and only 27 member states are in the eu   in addition  people living in areas such as   republic of ireland ireland    the   united kingdom    the   north atlantic   and   mediterranean   islands and also in   scandinavia   may routinely refer to   continental europe  continental  or  mainland  europe   simply as europe or  the continent     etymology    on a greek vase  tarquinia museum  circa 480 bc  in ancient   greek mythology      europa  mythology  europa   was a   phoenicia  n princess whom   zeus   abducted after assuming the form of a dazzling white bull  he took her to the island of   crete   where she gave birth to   minos      rhadamanthus    and   sarpedon    for   homer    europe        see also   list of greek place names    was a mythological queen of crete  not a geographical designation  the etymology of   europa   is uncertain   one theory suggests that it is derived from the   greek language greek            eurus     meaning  wide  broad   and                 ps      p      opt      meaning  eye  face  countenance    hence       wide gazing    broad of aspect   compare with   athena cult and attributes   glauk    p   is               grey eyed   athena   or   hera   bo    p   is            ox eyed   hera       broad   has been an   epithet   of earth itself in the reconstructed   proto indo european religion     another theory suggests that it is based on a   semitic   word such as the   akkadian language akkadian     erebu   meaning  to go down  set   cf    wikt occident occident        cognate   to phoenician     ereb    evening  west  and arabic   maghreb    hebrew   ma ariv    see also     erebus        proto indo european language pie      h sub 1  sub reg os     darkness    however    martin litchfield west   states that  phonologically  the match between europa s name and any form of the semitic word is very poor   whatever the origin of the name of the mythological figure         is first used as a geographical term in the 6th century bc  by greek geographers such as   anaximander   and   hecataeus of miletus hecataeus    anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the   phasis river    the modern rioni  in the caucasus  a convention still followed by   herodotus   in the 5th century bc   but the convention received by the   middle ages   and surviving into modern usage is that of the   roman era   used by roman era authors such as   posidonius       strabo    and   ptolemy    who took the    tanais    the modern don river  as the boundary  the term  europe  is first used for a cultural sphere in the   carolingian renaissance   of the 9th century  from that time  the term designated the sphere of influence of the   western church    as opposed to both the   eastern orthodox   churches and to the   islamic world    the modern convention  enlarging the area of  europe  somewhat to the east and the south east  develops in the 19th century most major world languages use words derived from  europa  to refer to the  continent   peninsula   chinese  for example  uses the word       a similar chinese derived term is also sometimes used in japanese such as in the japanese name of the european union   despite the   katakana   being more commonly used  however  in some turkic languages the originally persian name     frangistan      land of the   franks    is used casually in referring to much of

christians in the roman empire imperial persecution      early middle ages    during the   decline of the roman empire    europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the    age of migrations     there were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the   ostrogoths      visigoths      goths      vandals      huns      franks      angles      saxons      slavs      european avars avars      bulgars   and  later still  the   vikings   and   magyars     isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously  apart from this very few written records survive and much literature  philosophy  mathematics  and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from europe    pledges   fealty   to   charlemagne      holy roman emperor     from the 7th century  byzantine history was greatly affected by the rise of islam and the   caliphates    muslim   arabs   first invaded historically roman territory under   ab  bakr    first caliph of the   rashidun caliphate    who entered   roman syria   and   roman mesopotamia    under   umar    the second caliph  the muslims decisively conquered syria and mesopotamia  as well as   roman palestine      roman egypt    and parts of   asia minor   and   africa province roman north africa    this trend continued under umar s successors and under the   umayyad caliphate    which conquered the rest of mediterranean north africa and most of the   visigothic kingdom iberian peninsula    over the next centuries muslim forces were able to take further european territory  including   cyprus in the middle ages cyprus      malta      emirate of crete crete      emirate of sicily sicily   and   history of islam in southern italy parts of southern italy     in the east    volga bulgaria   became an islamic state in the tenth century  the muslim conquest of hispania began when the   moors    mostly   berber people berbers   with some   arab  s  invaded the   christian     visigoths visigothic   kingdom of   iberian peninsula iberia   in the year 711  under their berber leader   tariq ibn ziyad    they landed at   gibraltar   on 30 april and worked their way northward  tariq s forces were joined the next year by those of his superior    musa ibn nusair    during the eight year campaign most of the   iberian peninsula   was brought under   muslim   rule   save for small areas in the northwest    asturias    and largely   basque people basque   regions in the   pyrenees    with the exception of the basque   banu qasi   muslim dynasty  this territory  under the arabic name   al andalus    became part of the expanding   umayyad   empire the unsuccessful   siege of constantinople  717 718  second siege of constantinople    717  weakened the   umayyad umayyad dynasty   and reduced their prestige  after their success in overrunning iberia  the conquerors moved northeast across the pyrenees  but were defeated by the   frankish empire frank  ish leader   charles martel   at the   battle of tours battle of poitiers   in 732  though they continued to raid and capture cities as far as   avignon    the umayyads were overthrown in 750 by the    abb sids   and most of the umayyad clan massacred a surviving umayyad prince    abd ar rahman i    escaped to iberia and founded a new umayyad dynasty in the   caliph of cordoba emirate of cordoba     756   charles martel s son    pippin the short   retook   narbonne    and his grandson charlemagne established the   marca hispanica   across the pyrenees in part of what today is   catalonia    reconquering   girona   in 785 and   barcelona   in 801  the umayyads in iberia proclaimed themselves caliphs in 929 during the dark ages  the   western roman

under   clovis nbsp i       charlemagne    a frankish king of the   carolingian   dynasty who had conquered most of western europe  was anointed    holy roman emperor    by the pope in 800  this led to the founding of the   holy roman empire    which eventually became centred in the german principalities of central europe   the predominantly   medieval greek greek speaking     eastern roman empire   became known in the west as the   byzantine empire    its capital was   constantinople    emperor   justinian i   presided over constantinople s first golden age  he established a   code of justinian legal code    funded the construction of the   hagia sophia   and brought the christian church under state control   fatally weakened by the   siege of constantinople  1204  sack of

ages   the economic growth of europe around the year 1000  together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes  made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the   mediterranean sea    in this context  the growing independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the   maritime republics   a leading role in the european scene   and   philip ii of france    during the   third crusade    the middle ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure  the nobility and the clergy    feudalism   developed in   france   in the early middle ages and soon spread throughout europe   a struggle for influence between the   nobility   and the   monarchy   in england led to the writing of the   magna carta   and the establishment of a   parliament     the primary source of culture in this period came from the   roman catholic church    through monasteries and cathedral schools  the church was responsible for education in much of europe   in europe itself  the church organised the   inquisition   against heretics  in   spain    the   reconquista   concluded with the fall of   granada   in 1492  ending over seven centuries of islamic rule in the   iberian peninsula      by   batu khan   in 1238  during the   mongol invasion of europe     in the 11th and 12th centuries  constant incursions by nomadic   turkic peoples turkic   tribes  such as the   pechenegs   and the   cuman kipchak confederation cuman kipchaks    caused a massive migration of   slavic peoples slavic   populations to the safer  heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the rus  state to the south and east   like many other parts of   eurasia    these territories were   mongol invasion of rus overrun by the mongols     the invaders  who became known as   tatars    were mostly turkic under mongol command  they established the state of the   golden horde    which later adopted islam as a religion and ruled over modern day southern and central russia and ukraine for more than three centuries   the   great famine of 1315 1317   was the first   crisis of the late middle ages crisis   that would strike europe in the late middle ages   the period between 1348 and 1420 witnessed the heaviest loss  the population of   france in the middle ages france   was reduced by half    medieval britain was afflicted by 95 famines   and france suffered the effects of 75 or more in the same period   europe was devastated in the mid 14th century by the   black death    one of the most deadly   pandemic  s in human history which killed an estimated 25 nbsp million people in europe alone a third of the   medieval demography european population   at the time  the plague had a devastating effect on europe s social structure  it induced people to live for the moment as illustrated by   giovanni boccaccio   in     the decameron      1353   it was a serious blow to the roman catholic church and led to increased   persecution of jews    foreigners    beggars   and   leper  s   the plague is thought to have returned every generation with varying   virulence   and mortalities until

great schism    during this forty year period  two popes one in   avignon   and one in rome claimed rulership over the church  although the schism was eventually healed in 1417  the papacy s spiritual authority had suffered greatly  the church s power was further weakened by the protestant reformation  1517 1648   initially sparked   the ninety five theses by the works of   german theologian   martin luther    a result of the lack of reform within the church  the reformation also damaged the holy roman empire s power  as german princes became divided between   protestant   and roman catholic faiths   this eventually led to the   thirty years war    1618 1648   which crippled the holy roman empire and devastated much of   early modern history of germany germany    killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population   in the aftermath of the   peace of westphalia    france rose to predominance within europe   the 17th century in southern and eastern europe was a period of general decline   eastern europe experienced more than 150 famines in a 200 year period between 1501 to 1700   in the 15th 18th centuries  when the disintegrating khanates of the   golden horde   were

germany following the   anschluss    later that year  following the   munich agreement    germany annexed the   sudetenland    which was a part of   czechoslovakia   inhabited by ethnic germans  at the time  britain and france preferred a policy of   appeasement      1944 or 45  shortly afterwards  poland and hungary started to press for the annexation of parts of czechoslovakia with polish and hungarian majorities  hitler encouraged the slovaks to do the same and in early 1939  the remainder of czechoslovakia was split into the   protectorate of bohemia and moravia    controlled by germany

attacked the   occupation of the baltic states baltic countries   and later  finland  the british hoped to land at narvik and send troops to aid finland  but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle germany and cut the germans off from scandinavian resources  nevertheless  the germans knew of britain s plans and got to narvik first  repulsing the attack  around the same time  germany moved troops into denmark  which left no room for a front except for where the last war had been fought or by landing at sea  the   phoney war   continued in may 1940  germany attacked france through the low countries  france capitulated in june 1940  however  the british refused to negotiate peace terms with the germans and the war continued  by august germany began a   battle of britain bombing

gallery     geography   europe is a peninsula that makes up the western fifth of the   eurasia  n landmass  land relief in europe shows great variation within relatively small areas  the southern regions are more mountainous  while moving north the terrain descends from the high   alps      pyrenees    and   carpathian mountains carpathians    through hilly uplands  into broad  low northern plains  which are vast in the east  this extended lowland is known as the   great european plain    and at its heart lies the   north german plain    an arc of uplands also exists along the north western seaboard  which begins in the western parts of the islands of   great britain britain   and   ireland    and then continues along the mountainous  fjord cut spine of norway  this description is simplified  sub regions such as the   iberian peninsula   and the   italian peninsula   contain their own complex features  as does mainland central europe itself  where the relief contains many plateaus  river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend  sub regions like   iceland    britain  and ireland are special cases  the former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of europe  while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off    climate    s of europe and surrounding regions  br     br     europe lies mainly in the   temperate   climate zones  being subjected to   prevailing westerlies   the climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the   gulf stream     the gulf stream is nicknamed  europe s central heating   because it makes europe s climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be  the gulf stream not only carries warm water to europe s coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the atlantic ocean therefore the average temperature throughout the year of naples is 16 nbsp  c  60 8 nbsp  f   while it is only 12 nbsp  c  53 6 nbsp  f  in new york city which is almost on the same latitude  berlin  germany  calgary  canada  and irkutsk  in the asian part of russia  lie on around the same latitude  january temperatures in berlin average around 8 nbsp  c  15 nbsp  f  higher than those in calgary  and they are almost 22 nbsp  c  40 nbsp  f  higher than average temperatures in irkutsk  europe s most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous   southern europe   and a vast  partially underwater  northern plain ranging from ireland in the west to the   ural mountains   in the east  these two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the   pyrenees   and   alps     carpathian mountains carpathians    the northern plains are delimited in the west by the   scandinavian mountains   and the mountainous parts of the british isles  major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the   celtic sea    the   north sea    the   baltic sea   complex and   barents sea   the northern plain contains the old geological continent of   baltica    and so may be regarded geologically as the  main continent   while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents  most of the older geology of western europe existed as part of the ancient   microcontinent     avalonia       geological history    the geological history of europe traces back to the formation of the   baltic shield    fennoscandia  and the   sarmatian craton    both around 2 25 nbsp billion years ago  followed by the   volgo uralia   shield  the three together leading to the   east european craton        baltica    which became a part of the   supercontinent     columbia  supercontinent  columbia    around 1 1 nbsp billion years ago  baltica and arctica  as part of the   laurentia   block  became joined to   rodinia    later resplitting around 550 nbsp million years ago to reform as baltica  around 440 nbsp million years ago   euramerica   was formed from baltica and laurentia  a further joining with   gondwana   then leading to the formation of   pangea    around 190 nbsp million years ago  gondwana and   laurasia   split apart due to the widening of the atlantic ocean  finally  and very soon afterwards  laurasia itself split up again  into laurentia  north america  and the eurasian continent  the land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time  via   greenland    leading to interchange of animal species  from around 50 nbsp million years ago  rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of europe  and its connections with continents such as asia  europe s present shape dates to the late   tertiary period   about five million years ago     biodiversity     of europe and bordering regions  having lived side by side with agricultural peoples for millennia  europe s animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man  with the exception of   fennoscandia   and northern russia  few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in europe  except for various   national park  s the main natural vegetation cover in europe is mixed   forest    the conditions for growth are very favourable  in the north  the   gulf stream   and   north atlantic current north atlantic drift   warm the continent  southern europe could be described as having a warm  but mild climate  there are frequent summer droughts in this region  mountain ridges also affect the conditions  some of these    alps      pyrenees    are oriented east west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior  others are oriented south north    scandinavian mountains      dinaric alps dinarides      carpathian mountains carpathians      apennine mountains apennines    and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea  forests grow well on this side  while on the other side  the conditions are much less favourable  few corners of mainland europe have not been grazed by   livestock   at some point in time  and the cutting down of the pre agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems probably 80 to 90 per cent of europe was once covered by forest   it stretched from the mediterranean sea to the arctic ocean  though over half of europe s original forests disappeared through the centuries of   deforestation    europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest  such as the   taiga   of scandinavia and russia  mixed   rainforest  s of the caucasus and the   cork oak   forests in the western mediterranean  during recent times  deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted  however  in many cases monoculture   plantation  s of   pinophyta conifers   have replaced the original mixed natural forest  because these grow quicker  the plantations now cover vast areas of land  but offer poorer habitats for many european forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure  the amount of natural forest in western europe is just 2 3  or less  in european russia 5 10   the country with the smallest percentage of forested area is   iceland    1    while the most forested country is finland  77     in temperate europe  mixed forest with both   flowering plant broadleaf   and coniferous trees dominate  the most important species in central and western europe are   beech   and   oak    in the north  the taiga is a mixed   spruce     pine     birch   forest  further north within russia and extreme northern scandinavia  the taiga gives way to   tundra   as the arctic is approached  in the mediterranean  many   olive   trees have been planted  which are very well adapted to its arid climate    cupressus sempervirens mediterranean cypress   is also widely planted in southern europe  the semi arid mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest  a narrow east west tongue of eurasian   grassland    the   steppe    extends eastwards from   ukraine   and southern russia and ends in hungary and traverses into taiga to the north glaciation during the   quaternary glaciation most recent ice age   and the presence of man affected the distribution of   fauna of europe european fauna    as for the animals  in many parts of europe most large animals and top   predator   species have been hunted to extinction  the   woolly mammoth   was extinct before the end of the   neolithic   period  today   wolf wolves      carnivore  s  and   bears      omnivore  s  are endangered  once they were found in most parts of europe  however  deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further  by the   middle ages   the bears  habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover  today  the   european brown bear brown bear   lives primarily in the   balkan balkan peninsula    scandinavia  and russia  a small number also persist in other countries across europe  austria  pyrenees etc    but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat  in addition    polar bear  s may be found on   svalbard    a norwegian archipelago far north of scandinavia  the   eurasian wolf wolf    the second largest predator in europe after the brown bear  can be found primarily in   eastern europe   and in the balkans  with a handful of packs in pockets of   western europe    scandinavia  spain  etc     now live in nature preserves in   bialowieza forest    on the border between   poland   and   belarus       european wild cat  foxes  especially the red fox   jackal and different species of martens  hedgehogs  different species of reptiles  like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes  and amphibians  different birds  owls  hawks and other birds of prey  important european herbivores are snails  larvae  fish  different birds  and mammals  like rodents  deer and roe deer  boars  and living in the mountains  marmots  steinbocks  chamois among others the extinction of the   cretan dwarf hippopotamus dwarf hippos   and   dwarf elephant  s has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the   mediterranean   sea creatures are also an important part of european flora and fauna  the sea flora is mainly   phytoplankton    important animals that live in european seas are

and diversity  asia   a   toponymy toponym   dating back to   classical antiquity      is more a   human geography cultural concept    incorporating diverse regions and peoples than a   physical

government systems    definition and boundaries      greek three continent system     of asia and surrounding landmasses   the original distinction between europe and asia was made by the   ancient greek  s  they used the   aegean sea    the   dardanelles    the   sea of marmara    the   bosporus    the   black sea    the   kerch strait    and the   sea of azov   as the border between asia and europe  the   nile   was often used as the border between asia and   africa    then called libya   although some greek geographers suggested the   red sea   would form a better boundary     darius the great darius    canal between the nile and the red sea introduced considerable variation in opinion  under the   roman empire    the   don river  russia  don river   emptying into the black sea was the western border of asia  it was the northernmost navigable point of the european shore in the 15th century the red sea became established as the boundary between africa and asia  replacing the nile  as exploration developed  the border between asia and europe had to be redefined  as the borders of the time did not extend to the arctic   in the maps of the period    transcaucasia   was counted as asian  the incorporation of most of that region into the   soviet union   tended to push views of the border to the south  it also has many mountainous terrains   asia oceania boundary   the border between asia and oceania is placed somewhere in the   malay archipelago    the terms southeast asia and oceania  devised in the 19th century  have had  vastly different geographic meanings since their inception  oceania has never been asia  whatever it may have been defined to be  the chief factor in determining what islands of the malay archipelago are asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there  not all european   lewis and wigen assert   the narrowing of  southeast asia  to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process    it does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents  in addition to its general inherited geographical meaning  to which the entire literate world subscribes  asia has any number of agency specific meanings organizationally and operationally of use in more restricted fields of interest  for example  the world university service of canada uses the administrative divisions of the middle east and europe  and south and southeast asia their definition of  asia  is substantially different from the wider definition  and the same may apply to other agencies worldwide  some differing uses of  asia  have been promulgated by the news media reporting on current events  for example    bbc   news has an asia pacific section  which acquires news from anywhere in   australasia    oceania or the pacific side of the americas  from the time of   herodotus   a minority of geographers have rejected the three continent system  europe  africa  asia  on the grounds that there is no or is no substantial physical separation between them   geographically  asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of   eurasia   with europe being a northwestern   peninsula   of the landmass   or of   afro eurasia    geologically  asia  europe and africa make up a single continuous landmass  except for the suez canal  and share a common   continental shelf    almost all of europe and most of asia sit atop the   eurasian plate    adjoined on the south by the   arabian plate arabian   and   indian plate   and with the easternmost part of siberia  east of the   cherskiy range    on the   north american plate      etymology    asia was originally a concept of   western civilization     the place name   asia   in various forms in a large number of modern languages is of unknown ultimate provenience  its etymology and language of origin are uncertain  it appears to be one of the most ancient of recorded names  a number of theories have been published  english asia can be traced through the formation of english literature to latin literature  where it has the same form  asia  whether all uses and all forms of the name derive also from the latin of the   roman empire   is much less certain    classical antiquity   latin asia and greek      appear to be the same word  roman authors translated      as asia  the romans named a province asia  which was in the location of the then asia  there was an asia minor and an asia major  iraq   of which the name of minor survived  as the earliest evidence of the name is greek  it is likely circumstantially that asia came from       but ancient transitions  due to the lack of literary contexts  are difficult to catch in the act  the most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians  such as   herodotus    who were all greek  roman civilization hellenized extensively    ancient greek   certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name  the first continental use of asia is attributed to herodotus  about 440 nbsp bc   not because he innovated it  but because his   histories   are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail  he defines it carefully   mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read  but whose works are now missing   by it he means   anatolia   and the   achaemenid empire persian empire    in contrast to   greece   and   egypt    herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women s names were  given to a tract which is in reality one     europa  mythology  europa      asia  mythology  asia    and   libya  mythology  libya    referring to africa   stating that most greeks assumed that asia was named after the wife of   prometheus    i e    hesione     but that the   lydia  ns say it was named after asies  son of cotys  who passed the name on to a tribe at   sardis     in   greek mythology     asia             or  asie             was the name of a    nymph   or   titan  mythology  titan   goddess of lydia   herodotus  geographical puzzlement was perhaps only a form of disagreement  as  having read the earlier greek poetry along with everyone else literate  he would have known perfectly well why places received female names  athens  mycenae  thebes and many other locations in fact had them  in ancient greek religion  places were under the care of female divinities  parallel to guardian angels  the poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories  which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical greek drama and became  greek mythology  for example    hesiod   mentions the daughters of   tethys  mythology  tethys   and   oceanus ocean    among whom are a  holy company    who with the lord   apollo   and the rivers have youths in their keeping    many of these are geographic  doris  rhodea  europa  asia  hesiod explains   blockquote  for there are three thousand neat ankled daughters of ocean who are dispersed far and wide  and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters    blockquote  the   iliad    attributed by the ancient greeks to   homer    mentions two phrygians  the tribe that replaced the   luvians   in lydia  in the   trojan war   named   asius  mythology  asios    an adjective meaning  asian     and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in lydia as           bronze age   before greek poetry  the   aegean sea   area was in a   greek dark age    at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun  prior to then in the   bronze age   the records of the   assyrian empire    the   hittite empire   and the various   mycenaean greece mycenaean   states of greece mention a region undoubtedly asia  certainly in anatolia  including if not identical to lydia  these records are administrative and do not include poetry the mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 bc by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the   dorian invasion   to this time  the burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a greek syllabic script called   linear b    deciphered by a number of interested parties  most notably by a young world war ii cryptographer    michael ventris    subsequently assisted by the scholar    john chadwick    a major cache discovered by   carl blegen   at the site of ancient   pylos   included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods some of these are of women held in servitude  as study of the society implied by the content reveals   they were used in trades  such as cloth making  and usually came with children  the epithet  lawiaiai   captives   associated with some of them identifies their origin  some are ethnic names  one in particular  aswiai  identifies  women of asia    perhaps they were captured in asia  but some others  milatiai  appear to have been of   miletus    a greek colony  which would not have been raided for slaves by greeks  chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased   the name is also in the singular  aswia  which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it  there is a masculine form  aswios  this aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the hittites as assuwa  centered on lydia  or  roman asia   this name    assuwa    has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent  asia     the   assuwa league   was a confederation of states in western anatolia  defeated by the   hittites   under   tudhaliya i   around 1400 bc alternatively  the   etymology   of the term may be from the   akkadian language akkadian   word      which means  to go outside  or  to ascend   referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the middle east and also likely connected with the phoenician word   asa   meaning east  this may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for   europe    as being from akkadian   er bu m     to enter  or  set   of the sun  t r  reid supports this alternative etymology  noting that the ancient greek name must have derived from   asu    meaning  east  in   assyria  n    ereb   for   europe   meaning  west      the center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts  the   caucasus   and   himalaya   mountains and the   karakum desert karakum   and   gobi desert gobi   deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty  while the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially  in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe  however  the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force  for this and other reasons  the

scientia    meaning  knowledge   is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes   knowledge   in the form of testable   scientific theory explanations   and   predictability predictions   about the   universe     in an older and closely related meaning  found  for example  in   aristotle      science  refers to the body of reliable knowledge itself  of the type that can be logically and   reason rationally   explained    see   science history and philosophy history and philosophy   below      since   classical antiquity   science as a type of knowledge was closely linked to   philosophy    in the   early modern era   the words  science  and  philosophy  were sometimes used interchangeably in the   english language     by the 17th century    natural philosophy    which is today called    natural science     was considered a separate branch of   philosophy     however   science  continued to be used in a broad sense denoting reliable knowledge about a topic  in the same way it is still used in modern terms such as   library science   or   political science   in modern use   science  more often refers to a way of pursuing knowledge  not only the knowledge itself  it is  often treated as synonymous with  natural and physical science   and thus restricted to those branches of study that relate to the phenomena of the material universe and their laws  sometimes with implied exclusion of pure mathematics  this is now the dominant sense in ordinary use    this narrower sense of  science  developed as scientists such as   johannes kepler      galileo galilei   and   isaac newton   began formulating     laws of nature     such as   newton s laws of motion    in this period it became more common to refer to natural philosophy as  natural science   over the course of the 19th century  the word  science  became increasingly associated with the   scientific method    a disciplined way to study the natural world  including   physics      chemistry      geology   and   biology    it is in the 19th century also that the term     scientist     was created by the naturalist theologian   william whewell   to distinguish those who sought knowledge on nature from those who sought knowledge on other disciplines  the   oxford english dictionary   dates the origin of the word  scientist  to 1834  this sometimes left the study of human thought and society in a linguistic limbo  which was resolved by classifying these areas of academic study as   social science    similarly  several other major areas of disciplined study and knowledge exist today under the general rubric of  science   such as   formal science   and   applied science     history and philosophy     history     and   guanzi  text  kuan tzu    4th century bce   in an example of   multiple discovery simultaneous scientific discovery    mention that some   marine animal  s were subject to a lunar cycle  and increase and decrease in size with the waxing and waning of the moon  aristotle was referring specifically to the   sea urchin    pictured above    science in a broad sense existed before the   modern era    and in many historical   civilization  s  but   modern science   is so distinct in its   science scientific practice approach   and successful in its   science literature results   that it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term   much earlier than the modern era  another important turning point was the development of the classical   natural philosophy   in the ancient greek speaking world     pre philosophical    science in its original sense is a word for a type of knowledge    latin       wikt scientia scientia        ancient greek       wikt epistem  epistem        rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge  in particular it is one of the types of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share  for example  knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thinking  as shown by the construction of complex calendars  techniques for making poisonous plants edible  and buildings such as the pyramids  however no consistent distinction was made between knowledge of such things which are true in every community  and other types of communal knowledge such as mythologies and legal systems     philosophical study of nature    before the invention or discovery of the   concept   of    nature       ancient greek     phusis     by the   pre socratic philosopher  s  the same words tend to be used to describe the   natural    way  in which a plant grows   and the  way  in which  for example  one tribe worships a particular god  for this reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense  and also the first people to clearly distinguish  nature  and  convention    science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature  and the things which are true for every community  and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy nbsp   the realm of the first philosopher physicists  they were mainly speculators or   theory theorists    particularly interested in   astronomy    in contrast  trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature  artifice or technology  greek   techn     was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class artisans      philosophical turn to human things    a major turning point in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful attempt by   socrates   to apply philosophy to the study of human things  including human nature  the nature of political communities  and human knowledge itself  he criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative  and lacking in self criticism  he was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order  explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter the study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition  and socrates was executed    aristotle   later created a less controversial systematic programme of socratic philosophy  which was   teleological    and human centred  he rejected many of the conclusions of earlier scientists  for example in his physics the sun goes around the earth  and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans  each thing has a   formal cause   and   final cause   and a role in the rational cosmic order  motion and change is described as the   actualization   of potentials already in things  according to what types of things they are  while the socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being  they did not argue for any other types of applied science aristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans  treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity  practical thinking about good living as something less lofty  and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes  in contrast to modern science  aristotle s influential emphasis was upon the  theoretical  steps of   deductive reasoning deducing   universal rules from raw data  and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself      medieval science    during   late antiquity   and the   early middle ages    the aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomenon was used  some ancient knowledge was lost  or in some cases kept in obscurity  during the fall of the roman empire and periodic political struggles  however  the general fields of science  or   natural philosophy   as it was called  and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved though the works of the early encyclopedists like   isidore of seville    during the early medieval period  syrian christians from eastern europe such as nestorians and monophysites were the ones that translated much of the important   history of science in classical antiquity greek science   texts from greek to syriac and the later on they translated many of the works into arabic and other languages under islamic rule   this was a major line of transmission for the development of   islamic science   which provided much of the activity during the early medieval period  in the later medieval period  europeans recovered some ancient knowledge by translations of texts and they built their work upon the knowledge of aristotle    ptolemy      euclid    and others works  in europe  men like   roger bacon   learned   arabic   and   hebrew   and argued for more experimental science  by the late middle ages  a synthesis of catholicism and aristotelianism known as   scholasticism   was flourishing in   western europe    which had become a new geographic center of science     renaissance  and early modern science      is considered one of the fathers of modern science    by the late middle ages  especially in italy there was an influx of texts and scholars from the collapsing   byzantine empire      copernicus   formulated a   heliocentrism heliocentric   model of the solar system unlike the   geocentric model   of   ptolemy ptolemy s     almagest     all aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the 15th and 16th centuries  one author who was notoriously persecuted was   galileo    who made innovative use of experiment and mathematics  however the persecution began after pope urban viii blessed galileo to write about the copernican system  galileo had used arguments from the pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work  dialogue concerning the two chief world systems  which caused great offense to him    in northern europe  the new technology of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments including some that disagreed with church   dogma      ren  descartes   and   francis bacon   published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non aristotelian science  descartes argued that mathematics could be used in order to study nature  as galileo had done  and bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation  bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life bacon questioned the aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause  and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of  simple  natures  such as heat  rather than assuming that there is any specific nature  or    formal cause     of each complex type of thing  this new modern science began to see itself as describing    laws of nature     this updated approach to studies in nature was seen as   mechanistic       age of enlightenment    in the 17th and 18th centuries  the project of modernity  as had been promoted by bacon and descartes  led to rapid scientific advance and the successful development of a new type of natural science  mathematical  methodically experimental  and deliberately innovative    isaac newton newton   and   gottfried leibniz leibniz   succeeded in developing a new physics  now referred to as   newtonian physics    which could be confirmed by experiment and explained in mathematics  leibniz also incorporated terms from aristotelian physics  but now being used in a new non teleological way  for example    energy    and    potential     but in the style of bacon  he assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature  with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing it is  during this period that the word  science  gradually became more commonly used to refer to the pursuit of a type of knowledge  and especially knowledge of nature nbsp   coming close in meaning to the old term    natural philosophy        19th century    both   john herschel   and   william whewell   systematised methodology  the latter coined the term   scientist    when   charles darwin   published     on the origin of species     he established   descent with modification   as the prevailing   evolution  ary explanation of biological complexity  his theory of   natural selection   provided a natural explanation of how   species   originated  but this only gained wide acceptance a century later    john dalton   developed the idea of   atoms    the laws of   thermodynamics   and the   electromagnetic theory   were also established in the 19th century  which raised new questions which could not easily be answered using newton s framework     20th century and beyond      einstein   s   theory of relativity   and the development of   quantum mechanics   led to the replacement of newtonian physics with a new physics which contains two parts  that describe different types of events in nature  the extensive use of scientific innovation during the wars of this century  led to the   space race   and widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern science  more recently it has been argued that the ultimate purpose of science is to make sense of human beings and our nature  for example in his book     consilience        eo wilson   said  the human condition is the most important frontier of the natural sciences      jeremy griffith   supports this view     philosophy of science    working scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method   1  that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers   2  that this objective reality is governed by natural laws   3  that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation   philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid the belief that all observers share a common reality is known as   scientific realism realism     it can be contrasted with   anti realism    the belief that there is no valid concept of absolute truth such that things that are true for one observer are true for all observers   the most commonly defended form of anti realism is   idealism    the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence  and that each mind generates its own reality    in an idealistic world view  what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds there are different schools of thought in philosophy of science  the most popular position is   empiricism    which claims that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations   empiricism generally encompasses   inductivism    a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and the hence finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories  this is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite  which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using   deductive logic   only  many versions of empiricism exist  with the predominant ones being   bayesianism     and the   hypothetico deductive method    empiricism has stood in contrast to   rationalism    the position originally associated with   descartes    which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect  not by observation   a significant 20th century version of rationalism is   critical rationalism    first defined by austrian british philosopher   karl popper    popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation  he claimed that theories are not generated by observation  but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it   popper proposed   falsifiability   as the landmark of scientific theories  and   falsifiability falsificationism falsification   as the empirical method  to replace verifiability  and induction by purely deductive notions   popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method  and that this method is not specific to science  the negative method of criticism    trial and error     it covers all products of the human mind  including science  mathematics  philosophy  and art  another approach    instrumentalism    colloquially termed  shut up and calculate   emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena   it claims that scientific theories are black boxes with only their input  initial conditions  and output  predictions  being relevant  consequences  notions and logical structure of the theories are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn t make a fuss about  see   interpretations of quantum mechanics      paul k feyerabend   advanced the idea of   epistemological anarchism    which holds that there are no useful and exception free   methodology methodological rules   governing the   scientific progress progress of science   or the growth of   knowledge    and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic  pernicious and detrimental to science itself feyerabend advocates treating science as an   ideology   alongside others such as   religion      magic  paranormal  magic   and   mythology    and considers the dominance of science in society   authoritarian   and unjustified  he also contended  along with   imre lakatos    that the   demarcation problem   of distinguishing science from   pseudoscience   on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed  universal rules feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts  particularly the notion of   uniformitarianism uniformity of law and the uniformity of process across time and space    finally  another approach often cited in debates of   scientific skepticism   against controversial movements like    scientific creationism     is   methodological naturalism    its main point is that a difference between natural and   supernatural   explanations should be made  and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations   that the restriction is merely methodological  rather than ontological  means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself  but should not claim them to be wrong either  instead  supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science  methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to   empirical   study and   independent verification   as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for   observation observable   phenomena   the absence of these standards    appeal to authority arguments from authority    biased   observational studies   and other common   fallacy fallacies   are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as criteria for the dubious claims they criticize not to be true science   determines the genetic structure of all known life      certainty and science    a scientific theory is   empirical    and is always open to   falsifiability falsification   if new evidence is presented  that is  no theory is ever considered strictly   certainty certain   as science accepts the concept of   fallibilism    the philosopher of science   karl popper   sharply distinguishes truth from certainty  he writes that scientific knowledge  consists in the search for truth   but it  is not the search for certainty     all human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain new scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding  according to psychologist   keith stanovich    it may be the media s overuse of words like  breakthrough  that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false   while there are such famous cases as the   theory of relativity   that required a complete reconceptualization  these are extreme exceptions  knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments  by various researchers  across different branches of science  it is more like a climb than a leap   theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified  as well as their acceptance in the scientific community   for example    heliocentrism heliocentric theory      evolution the theory of evolution      relativity theory    and   germ theory of disease germ theory   still bear the name  theory  even though  in practice  they are considered   fact  ual  philosopher   barry stroud   adds that  although the best definition for    knowledge    is contested  being   skeptical   and entertaining the   possibility   that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct  ironically then  the scientist adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the   truth     the   fallibilist     charles sanders peirce c  nbsp s  peirce   argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome  verbal  or   hyperbolic doubt   is fruitless  but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense   he held that the successful sciences trust  not to any single chain of inference  no stronger than its weakest link   but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected  stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a  magic bullet   it avoids the   fallacy of the single cause single cause fallacy    this means a scientist would not ask merely  what is   the   cause of      but rather  what   are   the most significant   causes   of      this is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science  e g    psychology      cosmology      of course  research often analyzes few factors at once  but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider   another term    junk science    is often used to describe scientific hypotheses or conclusions which  while perhaps legitimate in themselves  are believed to be used to support a position that is seen as not legitimately justified by the totality of evidence  physicist   richard feynman   coined the term    cargo cult science    in reference to pursuits that have the formal trappings of science but lack  a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty  that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated   various types of commercial advertising  ranging from hype to fraud  may fall into these categories there also can be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of such debates  sometimes  research may be characterized as  bad science   research that is well intentioned but is seen as incorrect  obsolete  incomplete  or over simplified expositions of scientific ideas  the term    scientific misconduct    refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person    scientific practice    became much more   accurate   after   tycho brahe   devised his   measuring instrument scientific instrument  s for measuring angles between two   celestial body celestial bodies    before the invention of the telescope    tycho s observational astronomy brahe s observations   were the basis for   kepler s laws     a skeptical point of view  demanding a method of proof  was the practical position taken as early as 1000 years ago  with   alhazen        critique of ptolemy doubts concerning ptolemy      through bacon  1605   and   c  s  peirce    1839 1914   who note that a    scientific community community   will then spring up to address these points of uncertainty   the methods of   method of elenchus method inquiry   into a problem have been known for thousands of years   and extend beyond theory to practice  the use of   measurement  s  for example  is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community   john ziman   points out that   intersubjective verifiability intersubjective pattern recognition   is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge   ziman shows how scientists can identify  patterns to each other across centuries   illustration facing page 164  shows how today s trained western botanist can identify     artemisia absinthium artemisia alba     from images taken from a 16th century chinese pharmacopia   and ziman refers to this ability as  perceptual consensibility    ziman then makes consensibility  leading to consensus  the touchstone of reliable knowledge     the scientific method   the   scientific method   seeks to explain the events of   nature   in a   reproducible   way   an explanatory   thought experiment   or   hypothesis   is put forward  as explanation  using principles such as   parsimony    also known as    occam s razor     and are generally expected to seek   consilience   fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena   this new explanation is used to make   falsifiable   predictions that are testable by experiment or observation  the predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought  as proof that no tampering has occurred  disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress    this is done partly through observation of natural phenomena  but also through experimentation  that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions  as appropriate to the discipline  in the observational sciences  such as astronomy or geology  a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment   experimentation is especially important in science to help establish   causality causal relationships    to avoid the   correlation does not imply causation correlation fallacy     when a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory  it is either modified or discarded if the hypothesis survived testing  it may become adopted into the framework of a   theory  science  scientific theory    this is a logically reasoned  self consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena  a theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis  commonly  a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory  thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses  in that vein  theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses  in addition to testing hypotheses  scientists may also generate a   scientific modeling model   based on observed phenomena  this is an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical  physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested while performing experiments to test hypotheses  scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another  and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias    this can be achieved by careful   design of experiments experimental design    transparency  and a thorough   peer review   process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions    after the results of an experiment are announced or published  it is normal practice for independent researchers to double check how the research was performed  and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be   taken in its entirety  the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users  namely the   confirmation bias        mathematics and formal sciences        mathematics   is essential to the sciences  one important function of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models  observing and collecting   measurements    as well as hypothesizing and predicting  often require extensive use of mathematics    arithmetic      algebra      geometry      trigonometry   and   calculus    for example  are all essential to   physics    virtually every branch of mathematics has applications in science  including  pure  areas such as   number theory   and   topology     statistics statistical methods    which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data  allow scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental results  statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences   computational science   applies computing power to simulate real world situations  enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve  according to the   society for industrial and applied mathematics    computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge  whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate  some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists  regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments  others do not see mathematics as a science  since it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses  mathematical   theorem  s and   formula  s are obtained by   mathematical logic logical   derivations which presume   axiom  atic systems  rather than the combination of   empirical   observation and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the   scientific method    in general  mathematics is classified as   formal science    while natural and social sciences are classified as   empirical   sciences     basic and applied research   although some scientific research is   applied research   into specific problems  a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity driven undertaking of   basic research    this leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable  this point was made by michael faraday when  allegedly in response to the question  what is the   use   of basic research   he responded  sir  what is the use of a new born child     for example  research into the effects of red light on the human eye s   rod cells   did not seem to have any practical purpose  eventually  the discovery that our   night vision   is not troubled by red light would lead   search and rescue   teams  among others  to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters  in a nutshell  basic research is the search for knowledge  applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge  finally  even basic research can take unexpected turns  and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to   scientific method luck and science harness luck      research in practice   due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists  most of the cutting edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists  rather than individuals   d k  simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far  creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked  hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is  in his view  the future of science        radioactivity    1896  and   antimatter    1932       cancer   treatment  1896     pet scans    1961   and   medical research    via   isotopic labeling         immunology        vaccination    leading to the elimination of most infectious diseases from developed countries and the worldwide eradication of   smallpox      hygiene    leading to decreased transmission of infectious diseases    antibody antibodies    leading to techniques for disease diagnosis and   targeted therapy targeted   anticancer therapies       crystallography   and   quantum mechanics    1900        semiconductor device  s  1906   hence modern   computing   and   telecommunications   including the integration with wireless devices  the   mobile phone   nbsp    mathematics    which is classified as a   formal science      has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences  the natural and social sciences   it is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective  careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge  it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge  using   a priori and a posteriori   a priori     rather than empirical methods the formal sciences  which also include   statistics   and   logic    are vital to the empirical sciences  major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences  the formal sciences are essential in the formation of   hypothesis hypotheses      theory theories    and   physical law laws   both in discovering and describing how things work  natural sciences  and how people think and act  social sciences     institutions     visiting the in 1671    learned society learned societies   for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the   renaissance   period   the oldest surviving institution is the italian which was established in 1603   the respective national   academy of sciences academies of science   are distinguished institutions that exist in a number of countries  beginning with the british   royal society   in 1660  and the french in 1666  international scientific organizations  such as the   international council for science    have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations  many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research  prominent scientific organizations include  the   national science foundation   in the   united states u s     the   conicet national scientific and technical research council   in argentina  the   academy of sciences academies of science   of many nations    csiro   in australia  in france    max planck society   and in germany  and in spain    csic      literature   an enormous range of   scientific literature   is published     scientific journal  s communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions  serving as an archival record of science  the first scientific journals      journal des s avans     followed by the     philosophical transactions of the royal society philosophical transactions      began publication in 1665  since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased  as of 1981  one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11 500   the   united states national library of medicine   currently indexes 5 516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences  although the journals are in 39 languages  91 percent of the indexed articles are published in english  most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field  the research is normally expressed in the form of a   scientific paper    science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements  news  and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace   science magazine  s such as     newscientist new scientist          science   vie      and     scientific american     cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non technical summary of popular areas of research  including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research    science book  s engage the interest of many more people  tangentially  the   science fiction   genre  primarily fantastic in nature  engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas  if not the methods  of science recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non scientific disciplines such as   literature   or  more specifically    poetry    include the   creative writing science   resource developed through the   royal literary fund      science and society     women in science      the first astronomer to infer galactic clumping from astronomical data in 1953  was not allowed to use the telescope at palomar until 1965  with the given reason that the facility did not have a women s   restroom     science is largely a male dominated field  with notable exceptions   a large majority of male scientists are the ones who have made the discoveries  written the books and thus have written the rules of what to study and how to study it  there is evidence suggesting that this is a product of stereotypes  e g  science as  manly   as well as   self fulfilling prophecy self fulfilling prophecies      experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls  asking them to reflect more deeply and logically   physicist   evelyn fox keller   argues that science has   masculinity development masculine   stereotypes causing ego and competitiveness to obstruct progress  and that these tendencies prevent collaboration and sharing of information  women have faced a lot of discrimination getting not only credit for their scientific discoveries but also getting opportunities   both in research and professorship the quantity of females are very limited in comparison to their male counterparts   the lack of females in science can be directly associated with the social atmosphere which has always treated science as a more masculine area of study   beginning with boys being pushed more towards academia and girls being confined to the domestic sphere  females have faced both discrimination and difficulty entering into science  those who are a part of the scientific community find it difficult to break the  glass ceiling  which thus limits how far they can advance within the field  the barrier between work and home has also been an obstacle that women have had to overcome to succeed in the sciences  the achievements of women in science are attributed to their defiance of traditional status of being a laborer within the domestic sphere  feminist authors and leaders who hail from various educational backgrounds such as   londa schiebinger      anne fausto sterling      bonnie spanier    and   evelyn fox keller    have published many works interpreting and critiquing science from a feminist perspective  some criticisms include the gendered metaphors in science  the lack of representation of females in the sciences  how science is used to back up the ideals of patriarchy  and sex gender dichotomies    feminist science studies   as a sub genre of   women s studies   or   gender studies   are available as areas of study in many universities as a method of activism to promote and encourage awareness of social issues as well as promoting women and intersex individuals to contribute more to the sciences although it has been difficult for women to break into the field of science as credible contributors  many new discoveries have been a result of work by female scientists  some of the most famous females in the field include   marie curie    who made discoveries relating to radioactivity    rosalind franklin    who worked with x ray diffraction    caroline herschel    who was the first woman to be paid for her scientific work and   jane goodall    who is currently the world s foremost primatologist   these women helped establish a place for women in a heavily male dominated field    science and technology   research is often funded through a competitive process  in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding  such processes  which are run by government  corporations or foundations  allocate scarce funds  total research funding in most   developed country developed countries   is between 1 5  and 3  of   gross domestic product gdp      in the   oecd    around two thirds of   research and development   in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry  and 20  and 10  respectively by   universities   and government   the government funding proportion in certain industries is higher  and it dominates research in   social science   and   humanities    similarly  with some exceptions  e g    biotechnology    government provides the bulk of the funds for   basic science basic scientific research     in commercial research and development  all but the most research oriented corporations focus more heavily on near term commercialisation possibilities rather than    blue skies research blue sky    ideas or technologies  such as   nuclear fusion       media perspectives   the   mass media   face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole  determining how much weight to give different sides in a   scientific debate   may require considerable expertise regarding the matter   few journalists have real scientific knowledge  and even   beat reporter  s who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover      political usage   many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by   politician  s  as a very broad generalisation  many politicians seek certainties and   facts   whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats  however  politicians  ability to be heard in the   mass media   frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public  examples in   united kingdom britain   include the controversy over the   mmr vaccine mmr     inoculation    and the 1988 forced resignation of a government minister    edwina currie   for revealing the high probability that   battery cage battery   farmed eggs were contaminated with     salmonella        john horgan  american journalist  john horgan      chris mooney  journalist  chris mooney    and researchers from the us and canada have described scientific certainty argumentation methods  scams   where an organization or think tank makes it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with political agendas      hank campbell and microbiologist alex berezow have described  feel good fallacies  used in politics  where politicians frame their positions in a way that makes people feel good about supporting certain policies even when scientific evidence shows there is no need to worry or there is no need for dramatic change on current programs    see also      antiquarian science books      research      criticism of science      outline of science      protoscience      science wars

   structure       space      and other properties   it has no generally accepted   definitions of mathematics definition      galileo galilei    1564 1642  said   the universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written  it is written in mathematical language  and the letters are triangles  circles and other geometrical figures  without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word  without these  one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth      carl friedrich gauss    1777 1855  referred to mathematics as  the queen of the sciences      benjamin peirce    1809 1880  called mathematics  the science that draws necessary conclusions    david hilbert said of mathematics   we are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense  mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules  rather  it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise      albert einstein    1879 1955  stated that  as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality  they are not certain  and as far as they are certain  they do not refer to reality   mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields  including   natural science      engineering      medicine    and the   social sciences      applied mathematics    the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields  inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries  which has led to the development of entirely new mathematical disciplines  such as   statistics   and   game theory    mathematicians also engage in   pure mathematics    or mathematics for its own sake  without having any application in mind  there is no clear line separating pure and applied mathematics  and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered    etymology  the word   mathematics   comes from the   ancient greek language greek             m th ma     which  in the ancient greek language  means  what one learns    what one gets to know   hence also  study  and  science   and in modern greek just  lesson   the word   m th ma   is derived from            manthano     while the modern greek equivalent is            mathaino     both of which mean  to learn   in greece  the word for  mathematics  came to have the narrower and more technical meaning  mathematical study   even in classical times   its adjective is    math matik s     meaning  related to learning  or  studious   which likewise further came to mean  mathematical   in particular     math matik  t khn       meant  the mathematical art  in latin  and in english until around 1700  the term   mathematics   more commonly meant  astrology   or sometimes  astronomy   rather than  mathematics   the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800  this has resulted in several mistranslations  a particularly notorious one is   saint augustine   s warning that christians should beware of   mathematici   meaning astrologers  which is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians the apparent plural form in english  like the french plural form  and the less commonly used singular derivative   goes back to the latin neuter plural    cicero     based on the greek plural    ta math matik      used by   aristotle    384 322 bc   and meaning roughly  all things mathematical   although it is plausible that english borrowed only the adjective   mathematic al    and formed the noun   mathematics   anew  after the pattern of   physics   and   metaphysics    which were inherited from the greek   in english  the noun   mathematics   takes singular verb forms  it is often shortened to   maths   or  in english speaking north america    math      definitions of mathematics    aristotle   defined mathematics as  the science of quantity   and this definition prevailed until the 18th century   starting in the 19th century  when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as   group theory   and   projective geometry    which have no clear cut relation to quantity and measurement  mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions   some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics  some emphasize its abstractness  some emphasize certain topics within mathematics  today  no consensus on the definition of mathematics prevails  even among professionals   there is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science   a great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics  or consider it undefinable   all have severe problems  none has widespread acceptance  and no reconciliation seems possible   in the     principia mathematica        bertrand russell   and   alfred north whitehead   advanced the philosophical program known as   logicism    and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts  statements  and principles can be defined and proven entirely in terms of   symbolic logic    a logicist definition of mathematics is russell s  all mathematics is symbolic logic   1903     intuitionist   definitions  developing from the philosophy of mathematician   l e j  brouwer    identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena  an example of an intuitionist definition is  mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other    a   formal system   is a set of symbols  or   tokens    and some   rules   telling how the tokens may be combined into   formulas    in formal systems  the word   axiom   has a special meaning  different from the ordinary meaning of  a self evident truth   in formal systems  an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system   history     c  nbsp 570   c  nbsp 495 bc   commonly credited with discovering the   pythagorean theorem     the evolution of mathematics might be seen as an ever increasing series of   abstraction  mathematics  abstractions    or alternatively an expansion of subject matter  the first abstraction  which is shared by many animals   was probably that of   number  s  the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges  for example  have something in common  namely quantity of their members in addition to recognizing how to   counting count     physical   objects    prehistoric   peoples also recognized how to count   abstract   quantities  like time nbsp   days    season  s  years     elementary arithmetic      addition      subtraction      multiplication   and   division  mathematics  division    naturally followed since numeracy pre dated   writing    further steps were needed for recording numbers such as   tally sticks tallies   or the knotted strings called   quipu   used by the   inca   to store numerical data   numeral system  s have been many and diverse  with the first known written numerals created by   ancient egypt egyptians   in   middle kingdom of egypt middle kingdom   texts such as the   rhind mathematical papyrus     the earliest uses of mathematics were in   trade trading      land measurement      painting   and   weaving   patterns and the recording of time  more complex mathematics did not appear until around 3000 bc  when the   babylonian  s and egyptians began using arithmetic  algebra and geometry for   taxation   and other financial calculations  for building and construction  and for   astronomy     the systematic study of mathematics in its own right began with the   ancient greeks   between 600 and 300 bc  mathematics has since been greatly extended  and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and   science    to the benefit of both  mathematical discoveries continue to be made today  according to mikhail b  sevryuk  in the january 2006 issue of the     bulletin of the american mathematical society       the number of papers and books included in the     mathematical reviews     database since 1940  the first year of operation of mr  is now more than 1 9 million  and more than 75 thousand items are added to the database each year  the overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical   theorem  s and their   mathematical proof proofs       inspiration  pure and applied mathematics  and aesthetics     1643 1727   an   inventor   of   infinitesimal calculus     mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems  at first these were found in   commerce      land measurement      architecture   and later   astronomy    today  all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians  and many problems arise within mathematics itself  for example  the   physicist     richard feynman   invented the   path integral formulation   of   quantum mechanics   using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight  and today s   string theory    a still developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four   fundamental interaction fundamental forces of nature    continues to inspire new mathematics   some mathematics is only relevant in the area that inspired it  and is applied to solve further problems in that area  but often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas  and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts  a distinction is often made between   pure mathematics   and   applied mathematics    however pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications  e g    number theory   in   cryptography    this remarkable fact that even the  purest  mathematics often turns out to have practical applications is what   eugene wigner   has called    the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics      as in most areas of study  the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization  there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest   mathematics subject classification   runs to 46 pages   several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right  including   statistics      operations research    and   computer science   for those who are mathematically inclined  there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics  many mathematicians talk about the   elegance   of mathematics  its intrinsic   aesthetics   and inner   beauty      simplicity   and generality are valued  there is beauty in a simple and elegant   proof  mathematics  proof    such as   euclid   s proof that there are infinitely many   prime number  s  and in an elegant   numerical method   that speeds calculation  such as the   fast fourier transform      g h  hardy   in     a mathematician s apology     expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are  in themselves  sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics  he identified criteria such as significance  unexpectedness  inevitability  and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic   mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant  proofs from  the book  of god according to   paul erd s      the popularity of   recreational mathematics   is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions   notation  language  and rigor     who created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today  most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century   before that  mathematics was written out in words  a painstaking process that limited mathematical discovery     leonhard euler euler    1707 1783  was responsible for many of the notations in use today  modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional  but beginners often find it daunting  it is extremely compressed  a few symbols contain a great deal of information  like   musical notation    modern mathematical notation has a strict syntax  which to a limited extent varies from author to author and from discipline to discipline  and encodes information that would be difficult to write in any other way mathematical   language   can be difficult to understand for beginners  words such as   or   and   only   have more precise meanings than in everyday speech  moreover  words such as     open set open     and     field  mathematics  field     have been given specialized mathematical meanings  technical terms such as     homeomorphism     and     integral integrable     have precise meanings in mathematics  additionally  shorthand phrases such as   iff   for    if and only if    belong to   mathematical jargon    there is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary  mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech  mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as  rigor    mathematical proof   is fundamentally a matter of   rigor    mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning  this is to avoid mistaken    theorem  s   based on fallible intuitions  of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject   the level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time  the greeks expected detailed arguments  but at the time of   isaac newton   the methods employed were less rigorous  problems inherent in the definitions used by newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th century  misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics   today  mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about   computer assisted proof  s  since large computations are hard to verify  such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous    axiom  s in traditional thought were  self evident truths   but that conception is problematic  at a formal level  an axiom is just a string of symbols  which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an   axiomatic system    it was the goal of   hilbert s program   to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis  but according to   g del s incompleteness theorem   every  sufficiently powerful  axiomatic system has   independence  mathematical logic  undecidable   formulas  and so a final   axiomatization   of mathematics is impossible  nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be  as far as its formal content  nothing but   set theory   in some axiomatization  in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory    fields of mathematics     a simple calculating tool used since ancient times   mathematics can  broadly speaking  be subdivided into the study of quantity  structure  space  and change  i e    arithmetic      algebra      geometry    and   mathematical analysis analysis     in addition to these main concerns  there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields  to   mathematical logic logic    to   set theory      foundations of mathematics foundations     to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences    applied mathematics     and more recently to the rigorous study of   uncertainty      foundations and philosophy   in order to clarify the   foundations of mathematics    the fields of   mathematical logic   and   set theory   were developed  mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of   logic   and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics  set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies   set  mathematics  sets   or collections of objects    category theory    which deals in an abstract way with   mathematical structure  s and relationships between them  is still in development  the phrase  crisis of foundations  describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930   some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day  the crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time  including the   controversy over cantor s theory controversy over cantor s set theory   and the   brouwer hilbert controversy   mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous   axiom  atic framework  and studying the implications of such a framework  as such  it is home to   g del s incompleteness theorems   which  informally  imply that any effective   formal system   that contains basic arithmetic  if   sound    meaning that all theorems that can be proven are true   is necessarily   incomplete    meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved   in that system     whatever finite collection of number theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation  g del showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number theoretical fact  but which does not follow from those axioms  therefore no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory  modern logic is divided into   recursion theory      model theory    and   proof theory    and is closely linked to   theoretical computer science theoretical     computer science   as well as to   category theory     theoretical computer science   includes   computability theory  computation  computability theory      computational complexity theory    and   information theory    computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer  including the most well known model nbsp   the   turing machine    complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer  some problems  although theoretically solvable by computer  are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible  even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware  a famous problem is the    p   np problem    problem  one of the   millennium prize problems     finally  information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium  and hence deals with concepts such as   data compression compression   and   entropy  information theory  entropy      style  border 1px solid  ddd  text align center  margin auto  cellspacing  15   math p  rightarrow q     math

the familiar   natural number  s and   integer  s   whole numbers   and arithmetical operations on them  which are characterized in   arithmetic    the deeper properties of integers are studied in   number theory    from which come such popular results as   fermat s last theorem    the   twin prime   conjecture and   goldbach s conjecture   are two unsolved problems in number theory as the number

 which are used to represent   continuous function continuous   quantities  real numbers are generalized to   complex number  s  these are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include   quarternion  s and   octonion  s  consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the   transfinite number  s  which formalize the concept of    infinity     another area of study is size

not experimentally   falsifiability falsifiable    and thus not a science according to the definition of   karl popper     however  in the 1930s   g del s incompleteness theorems   convinced many

notably   imre lakatos    have applied a version of   falsificationism   to mathematics itself an alternative view is that certain scientific fields  such as   theoretical physics    are mathematics

 citation needed date august 2009  the opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied  many mathematicians  who date august 2009   feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side  and its history in the traditional seven   liberal arts    others  who date august 2009   feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and   engineering   has driven much development in mathematics  one way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is   created    as in art  or   discovered    as in science   it is common to see   university universities   divided into sections that include a division of   science and mathematics    indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide  in practice  mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the

sometimes debate the   historiography nature of history   and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing  perspective  on the problems of the present    stories common to a particular culture  but not supported by external sources  such as the tales surrounding   king arthur    are usually classified as   cultural heritage   or   legend  s  because they do not support the  disinterested investigation  required of the discipline of history     events occurring prior to written record are considered   prehistory     herodotus    a 5th century b c    greek historiography greek historian   is considered within the western tradition to be the  father of history   and  along with his contemporary   thucydides    helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history  their work continues to be read today and the divide between the culture focused herodotus and the military focused thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing  in the eastern tradition  a state chronicle the   spring and autumn annals   was known to be compiled from as early as 722 bce although only 2nd century bce texts survived ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today  the modern study of history is wide ranging  and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation  often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education  and the academic study of history is a   list of academic disciplines history major discipline   in university studies   etymology     1896   a derivation from    weid     know

used the word in his     per  t  z a  istor ai    inquiries about animals    the ancestor word is attested early on in   homeric hymns      heraclitus    the   athens athenian     ephebos ephebes    oath  and in   boeotia boiotic   inscriptions  in a legal sense  either  judge  or  witness   or similar  the word entered the   english language   in 1390 with the meaning of  relation of incidents  story   in   middle english    the meaning was  story  in general  the restriction to the meaning  record of past events  arises in the late 15th century  it was still in the greek sense that   francis bacon   used the term in the late 16th century  when he wrote about    natural history natural history     for him    historia   was  the knowledge of objects determined by space and time   that sort of knowledge provided by   memory    while   science   was provided by   reason    and   poetry   was provided by   fantasy    in an expression of the linguistic   synthetic language synthetic vs  analytic isolating dichotomy    english like chinese    vs     now designates separate words for human history and   storytelling   in general  in modern german  french  and most germanic and romance languages  which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected  the same word is still used to mean both  history  and  story  the adjective   historical   is attested from 1661  and   historic   from 1669    historian   in the sense of a  researcher of history  is attested from 1531  in all   european languages    the substantive  history  is still used to mean both  what happened with men   and  the scholarly study of the happened   the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter   history   or the word     historiography       the modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse all events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record   the task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past  therefore  the constitution of the historian s archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents  by falsifying their claims to represent the  true past   the study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the   humanities   and at other times as part of the   social sciences     it can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas  incorporating methodologies from both  some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification   in the 20th century  french   historian     fernand braudel   revolutionized the study of history  by using such outside disciplines as   economics      anthropology    and   geography   in the study of global history traditionally  historians have recorded events of the past  either in writing or by passing on an   oral tradition    and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts  for the beginning  historians have also used such sources as monuments  inscriptions  and pictures  in general  the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories  what is written  what is said  and what is physically preserved  and historians often consult all three   but writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before   archaeology   is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects  which  once unearthed  contribute to the study of history  but archaeology rarely stands alone  it uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries  however  archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history  that is to say  archaeology does not  fill the gaps  within textual sources  indeed  historical archaeology is a specific branch of archaeology  often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources  for example  mark leone  the excavator and interpreter of historical   annapolis  maryland    usa has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record  demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment  despite the ideology of  liberty  inherent in written documents at this time there are varieties of ways in which history can be organized  including chronologically    culture culturally    territorially  and thematically  these divisions are not mutually exclusive  and significant overlaps are often present  as in  the international women s movement in an age of transition  1830 1975   it is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general  although the modern trend has been toward specialization  the area called   big history   resists this specialization  and searches for universal patterns or trends  history has often been studied with some practical or   theory theoretical   aim  but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity    history and prehistory  the   history of the world   is the memory of the past   experience   of     homo sapiens sapiens     around the world  as that experience has been preserved  largely in written records  by  prehistory   historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist  or where the writing of a culture is not understood  by studying painting  drawings  carvings  and other artifacts  some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record  since the 20th century  the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history s implicit exclusion of certain civilizations  such as those of   sub saharan africa   and   pre columbian   america  historians in the west have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the   western world     in 1961  british historian   e  h  carr   wrote this definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples  such as   australian aboriginals   and new zealand   m ori people m ori   in the past  and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations  even before their contact with european civilization   historiography  historiography has a number of related meanings  firstly  it can refer to how history has been produced  the story of the development of   historical method methodology   and practices  for example  the move from short term biographical narrative towards long term thematic analysis   secondly  it can refer to what has been produced  a specific body of historical writing  for example   medieval historiography during the 1960s  means  works of medieval history written during the 1960s    thirdly  it may refer to why history is produced  the   philosophy of history    as a   meta level   analysis of descriptions of the past  this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives    language interpretation interpretations      worldview    use of   evidence    or method of presentation of other   historian  s  professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single

however  his contemporary   thucydides    ca  460 bc   ca  400 bc  is credited with having first approached history with a well developed historical method in his work the   history of the peloponnesian war    thucydides  unlike herodotus  regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings  and looked at cause and effect  rather than as the result of divine intervention  there were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval   china    the groundwork for professional historiography in   east asia   was

 polity  state      communication      propaganda   and   systematic bias   in history   and he is thus considered to be the  father of historiography    or the  father of the philosophy of history   in the west historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries  especially in france and germany  the 19th century historian with greatest influence on methods was   leopold von ranke   in germany in the 20th century  academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives  which often tended to glorify the nation or   great men theory great men    to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces  a major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a   social science   rather than as an   art    which traditionally had been the case  some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included   fernand braudel      e  h  carr      fritz fischer      emmanuel le roy ladurie      hans ulrich wehler      bruce trigger      marc bloch      karl dietrich bracher      peter gay      robert fogel      lucien febvre   and   lawrence stone    many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi disciplinary approach  braudel combined history with geography  bracher history with political science  fogel history with economics  gay history with psychology  trigger history with archaeology while wehler  bloch  fischer  stone  febvre and le roy ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology  geography  anthropology  and economics  more recently  the field of   digital history   has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship in opposition to the claims of history as a social science  historians such as   hugh trevor roper      john lukacs      donald creighton      gertrude himmelfarb   and   gerhard ritter   argued that the key to the historians  work was the power of the   imagination    and hence contended that history should be understood as an art  french historians associated with the   annales school   introduced quantitative history  using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals  and were prominent in the establishment of   cultural history    cf      histoire des mentalit s       intellectual historians such as   herbert butterfield      ernst nolte   and   george mosse   have argued for the significance of ideas in history  american historians  motivated by the civil rights era  focused on formerly overlooked ethnic  racial  and socio economic groups  another genre of   social history   to emerge in the post wwii era was

depends on the   calendar era dating system   used  most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past  the way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied     geographical locations   particular   geographical   locations can form the basis of historical study  for example    continent  s    countries   and   cities    understanding why historic events took place is important  to do this  historians often turn to   geography    weather patterns  the water supply  and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there  for example  to explain why the ancient egyptians developed a successful civilization  studying the   geography of egypt   is essential  egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the nile river  which flooded each year  depositing soil on its banks  the rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities  that meant everyone did not have to farm  so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization     world    world history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so  it has led to highly controversial interpretations by   oswald spengler   and   arnold j  toynbee    among others  world history is especially important as a teaching field  it

southeast asia   has been characterized as interaction between regional players and foreign powers    military history     military history   concerns warfare  strategies  battles  weapons  and the psychology of combat   the  new military history  since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals  with psychology more than tactics  and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture     history of religion   the history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries  and continues to be taught in seminaries and

called the   new social history    is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life   in its  golden age  it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars  and still is well represented in history departments  in two decades from 1975 to 1995  the proportion of professors of history in american universities identifying with social history rose from 31  to 41   while the proportion of political historians fell from 40  to 30     in the history departments of british universities in 2007  of the 5723 faculty members  1644  29    identified themselves with    social history    while   political history   came next with 1425  25    the  old  social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme  and it often included political movements  like populism  that were  social  in the sense of being outside the elite system  social history was contrasted with   political history      intellectual history   and the history of   great man theory great men    english historian   g  m  trevelyan   saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history  reflecting that   without social history  economic history is barren and political history unintelligible    while the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out  it has also been defended as  history with the people put back in       subfields    the chief subfields of social history include   width 50      demographic history  disambiguation  demographic history      black

popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience  it examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge  customs  and arts of a group of people  how

other high rulers and views them as being the driving force of continuity and change in history  this type of   political history   is the study of the conduct of   international relations history international relations   between states or across state boundaries over time  this is the most common form of history and is often the classical and popular belief of what history should be    economic history   although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century  in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments     environmental history   environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment  especially in the long run  and the impact of human activities upon it     world history   world history is primarily a teaching field  rather than a research field   it gained popularity in the united states   japan  and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds the world history association publishes the   journal of world history   every quarter since 1990   the h world discussion list  serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history  with discussions among scholars  announcements  syllabi  bibliographies and book reviews    people s history   a   people s history   is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the   populism perspective of common people    a people s history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders  individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus  which includes the   disfranchisement disenfranchised    the   oppression oppressed    the   poverty poor    the   nonconformism nonconformists    and the otherwise forgotten people  this history also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time  or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur    historiometry     historiometry   is a historical study of human progress or individual personal characteristics  by using statistics to analyze references to eminent persons  their statements  behavior and discoveries in relatively neutral texts    gender history     gender history   is a sub field of history and   gender studies    which looks at the past from the perspective of   gender    it is in many ways  an outgrowth of   women s history    despite its relatively short life  gender history  and its forerunner women s history  has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history  since the 1960s  when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance  it has gone through a number of different phases  each with its own challenges and outcomes  although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious  such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession  other influences are more subtle    public history     public history   describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings  public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation  archival science  oral history  museum curatorship  and other related fields  the term itself began to be used in the u s  and canada in the late 1970s  and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time  some of the most common settings for public history are museums  historic homes and historic sites  parks  battlefields  archives  film and television companies  and all levels of government   historians  professional and amateur historians discover  collect  organize  and present information about past events  in   list of historians lists of historians    historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing  which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized  chroniclers and annalists  though they are not historians in the true sense  are also frequently included   the judgement of history  since the 20th century  western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the  judgement of history    the goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of   legal judgement  s  that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final   a related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of   collective memory     pseudohistory      pseudohistory     is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard   historical method historiographical conventions   in a way which undermines their conclusions closely related to deceptive   historical revisionism  negationism  historical revisionsm    works which draw controversial conclusions from new  speculative  or disputed historical evidence  particularly in the fields of national  political  military  and religious affairs  are often rejected as pseudohistory   teaching history  from the origins of national school systems in the 19th century  the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority   in the united states after world war i  a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in western civilization  so as to give students a common heritage with europe  in the u s  after 1980 attention increasingly moved toward teaching   world history   or requiring students to take courses in non western cultures  to prepare students for life in a globalized economy  at the university level  historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities  many view the field from both perspectives the teaching of history in french schools was influenced by the   nouvelle histoire   as disseminated after the 1960s by   cahiers p dagogiques and enseignement   and other journals for teachers  also influential was the institut national de recherche et de documentation p dagogique   inrdp    joseph leif  the inspector general of teacher training  said pupils children should learn about historians  approaches as well as facts and dates  louis fran ois  dean of the history geography group in the inspectorate of national education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote  active methods  which would give pupils  the immense happiness of discovery   proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored  traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of french patriotism and national identity     bias in school teaching   in most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism  and give students the official line about national enemies  in many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light  for example  in japan  mention of the   nanking massacre   has been removed from textbooks and the entire world war ii is given cursory treatment  other countries have complained   it was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid marxist historiography   according to sociologist   james loewen    in the united states the history of the   american civil war   some places has been phrased to avoid giving offense to white southerners  and blacksacademic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks  sometimes with success   in 21st century germany  the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states  and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an  almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone  and reflects  principles formulated by international organizations such as unesco or the council of europe  thus oriented towards human rights  democracy and peace    the result is that  german textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy  progress  human rights  peace  tolerance and europeanness     see also    main outline of history glossary of history

psichiologia de ratione animae humanae   in the late 15th century or early 16th century   the earliest known reference to the word   psychology   in english was by   steven blankaart   in 1694 in   the physical dictionary   which refers to  anatomy  which treats of the body  and psychology  which treats of the soul     history     seated  with colleagues in his psychological laboratory  the first of its kind  wundt is credited with setting up psychology as a field of scientific inquiry independent of the disciplines philosophy and biology   the study of psychology in a   philosophy philosophical   context dates back to the ancient civilizations of   ancient egypt egypt      ancient greece greece      history of china china      history of india india    and   persian empire persia    historians point to the writings of ancient greek philosophers  such as   thales      plato    and   aristotle    especially in his     on the soul de anima     treatise    as the first significant body of work in the west to be rich in psychological thought   as early as the 4th century bc  greek physician   hippocrates   theorized that   mental disorder  s were of a physical  rather than divine  nature     structuralism   german physician   wilhelm wundt   is credited with introducing psychological discovery into a   laboratory   setting  known as the  father of   experimental psychology      wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components  motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry  and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of material   although wundt  himself  was not a structuralist  his student   edward titchener    a major figure in early american psychology  was a structuralist thinker opposed to functionalist approaches    functionalism   functionalism formed as a reaction to the theories of the structuralist school of thought and was heavily influenced by the work of the american philosopher  scientist  and psychologist   william james    james felt that psychology should have practical value  and that psychologists should find out how the mind can function to a person s benefit  in his book      principles of psychology       published in 1890  he laid the foundations for many of the questions that psychologists would explore for years to come  other major functionalist thinkers included   john dewey   and   harvey carr   other 19th century contributors to the field include the german psychologist   hermann ebbinghaus    a pioneer in the experimental study of   memory    who developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting at the   university of berlin     and the russian soviet   physiologist     ivan pavlov    who discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed    classical conditioning    and applied to human beings  starting in the 1950s  the experimental techniques set forth by wundt  james  ebbinghaus  and others would be reiterated as experimental psychology became increasingly   cognition cognitivist   concerned with   information   and its   information processing processing   and  eventually  constituted a part of the wider   cognitive science     as it both responded to and reacted against strains of thought  including   psychodynamics   and   behaviorism    that had developed in the meantime    psychoanalysis   from the 1890s until his death in 1939  the austrian physician   sigmund freud   developed   psychoanalysis    which comprised a method of investigating the mind and interpreting experience  a systematized set of theories about human behavior  and a form of   psychotherapy   to treat psychological or emotional distress  especially unconscious   conflict  process  conflict     freud s psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods    introspection   and clinical observations  it became very well known  largely because it tackled subjects such as   human sexuality sexuality      psychological repression repression    and the   unconscious mind   as general aspects of psychological development  these were largely considered   taboo   subjects at the time  and freud provided a catalyst for them to be openly discussed in polite society  clinically  freud helped to pioneer the method of   free association  psychology  free association   and a therapeutic interest in   dream interpretation        front row    sigmund freud      g  stanley hall      carl jung    back row    abraham a  brill      ernest jones      s ndor ferenczi     freud had a significant influence on swiss   psychiatrist     carl jung    whose   analytical psychology   became an alternative form of   depth psychology    other well known psychoanalytic scholars of the mid 20th century included psychoanalysts  psychologists  psychiatrists  and philosophers  among these thinkers were   erik erikson      melanie klein      donald winnicott d w  winnicott      karen horney      erich fromm      john bowlby    and sigmund freud s daughter    anna freud    throughout the 20th century  psychoanalysis evolved into diverse schools of thought  most of which may be classed as   neo freudian    psychoanalytic theory and therapy were criticized by psychologists such as   hans eysenck    and by philosophers including   karl popper    popper  a   philosophy of science philosopher of science    argued that psychoanalysis had been misrepresented as a scientific discipline   whereas eysenck said that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by   experiment  al data  by the end of 20th century  psychology departments in   higher education in the united states american universities   had become   positivism scientifically oriented    marginalizing freudian theory and dismissing it as a  desiccated and dead  historical artifact   meanwhile  however  researchers in the emerging field of   neuro psychoanalysis   defended some of freud s ideas on scientific grounds   while scholars of the   humanities   maintained that freud was not a  scientist at all  but     an   hermeneutics interpreter      he believed that the contents of the mind were not open to scientific scrutiny and that scientific psychology should emphasize the study of observable behavior  he focused on behavior environment relations and analyzed overt and covert  i e   private  behavior as a function of the organism interacting with its environment   behaviorists usually rejected or deemphasized   dualism  philosophy of mind  dualistic   explanations such as  mind  or    consciousness     and  in lieu of probing an  unconscious mind  that underlies unawareness  they spoke of the  contingency shaped behaviors  in which unawareness becomes outwardly manifest    skinner s version of behaviorism emphasized operant conditioning  through which behaviors are strengthened or weakened by their consequences linguist   noam chomsky   s critique of the behaviorist model of   language acquisition   is widely regarded as a key factor in the decline of behaviorism s prominence     martin seligman   and colleagues discovered that the conditioning of dogs led to outcomes     learned helplessness     that opposed the predictions of behaviorism    but skinner s behaviorism did not die  perhaps in part because it generated successful practical applications     humanism    humanistic psychology was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis   by using   phenomenology  psychology  phenomenology      intersubjectivity    and first person categories  the humanistic approach sought to glimpse the whole person not just the fragmented parts of the personality or cognitive functioning   humanism focused on fundamentally and uniquely human issues  such as individual free will  personal growth    self actualization      self concept self identity      death      loneliness as human condition aloneness      free will freedom    and   meaning  existential  meaning    the humanistic approach was distinguished by its emphasis on subjective meaning  rejection of determinism  and concern for positive growth rather than pathology some of the founders of the humanistic school of thought were american psychologists   abraham maslow    who formulated a   maslow s hierarchy of needs hierarchy of human needs    and   carl rogers    who created and developed   client centered therapy    later    positive psychology   opened up humanistic themes to scientific modes of exploration    gestalt     wolfgang kohler      max wertheimer   and   kurt koffka   co founded the school of   gestalt psychology    this approach is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes  this approach to psychology began in germany and austria during the late 19th century in response to the molecular approach of structuralism  rather than   reductionism breaking down   thoughts and behavior to their smallest element  the gestalt position maintains that the whole of experience is important  and the whole is different than the sum of its parts gestalt psychology should not be confused with the   gestalt therapy   of   fritz perls    which is only peripherally linked to gestalt psychology    existentialism   in the 1950s and 1960s  largely influenced by the work of german philosopher   martin heidegger   and danish philosopher   s ren kierkegaard    psychoanalytically trained american psychologist   rollo may   pioneered an   existential   branch of psychology  which included   existential therapy existential psychotherapy    a method of therapy that operates on the belief that inner conflict within a person is due to that individual s confrontation with the givens of existence existential psychologists differed from others often classified as humanistic in their comparatively neutral view of   human nature   and in their relatively positive assessment of   anxiety     existential psychologists emphasized the humanistic themes of death  free will  and meaning  suggesting that meaning can be shaped by   myth  s  or narrative patterns   and that it can be encouraged by an acceptance of the free will requisite to an   authenticity  philosophy  authentic    albeit often anxious  regard for death and other future prospects austrian existential psychiatrist and   holocaust   survivor   viktor frankl   drew evidence of meaning s therapeutic power from reflections garnered from his own   internment     and he created a variation of existential psychotherapy called   logotherapy    a type of   existentialism existentialist   analysis that focuses on a     meaning  existential  will to meaning      in one s life   as opposed to adler s   nietzsche  an doctrine of     will to power     or freud s     pleasure principle  psychology  will to pleasure      in addition to may and frankl  swiss psychoanalyst   ludwig binswanger   and american psychologist   george kelly  psychologist  george kelly   may be said to belong to the existential school     cognitivism      cognitive psychology is the branch of psychology that studies mental processes including   problem solving      perception      memory    and   learning    as part of the larger field of   cognitive science    this branch of psychology is related to other disciplines including neuroscience  philosophy  and linguistics   noam chomsky   helped to launch a    cognitive revolution    in psychology when he criticized the behaviorists  notions of  stimulus    response   and  reinforcement   chomsky argued that such ideas which skinner had borrowed from animal experiments in the laboratory could be applied to complex human behavior  most notably language acquisition  in only a superficial and vague manner  the postulation that humans are born with the instinct or    language acquisition device innate facility    for acquiring language posed a challenge to the behaviorist position that all behavior  including language  is contingent upon learning and reinforcement     social learning theorist  s  such as   albert bandura    argued that the child s environment could make contributions of its own to the behaviors of an observant subject     psychologists make inferences about mental processes from shared phenomena such as optical illusions   meanwhile  accumulating   technology   helped to renew interest and belief in the mental states and representations i e   the   cognition   that had fallen out of favor with behaviorists  english neuroscientist   charles sherrington   and canadian psychologist   donald o  hebb   used experimental methods to link psychological phenomena with the structure and function of the   human brain brain    with the rise of   computer science   and   artificial intelligence    analogies were drawn between the processing of information by humans and   information processing   by machines  research in cognition had proven practical since   world war ii    when it aided in the understanding of weapons operation   by the late 20th century  though    cognitivism  psychology  cognitivism   had become the dominant   paradigm   of psychology  and   cognitive psychology   emerged as a popular branch assuming both that the covert mind should be studied  and that the scientific method should be used to study it  cognitive psychologists set such concepts as     subliminal message subliminal processing     and     implicit memory     in place of the psychoanalytic   unconscious mind   or the behavioristic   contingency shaped behaviors    elements of behaviorism and cognitive psychology were synthesized to form the basis of   cognitive behavioral therapy    a form of psychotherapy modified from techniques developed by american psychologist   albert ellis  psychologist  albert ellis   and american psychiatrist   aaron t  beck    cognitive psychology was subsumed along with other disciplines  such as   philosophy of mind    computer science  and   neuroscience    under the cover discipline of cognitive science      subfields  psychology encompasses a vast domain and includes

psychologist  s use animal models  typically rats  to study the neural  genetic  and cellular mechanisms that underlie specific behaviors such as learning and memory and fear responses     cognitive neuroscientist  s investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in humans using neural imaging tools  and   neuropsychologist  s conduct psychological assessments to determine  for instance  specific aspects and extent of cognitive deficit caused by brain damage or disease    clinical    clinical psychology includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding  preventing  and relieving psychologically based distress or   mental illness dysfunction   and to promote subjective   mental health well being   and personal development  central to its practice are psychological assessment and   psychotherapy    although clinical psychologists may also engage in research  teaching  consultation  forensic testimony  and program development and administration   some clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with   brain damage brain injury   this area is known as   clinical neuropsychology    in many countries  clinical psychology is a regulated   mental health profession   the work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches  all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client  usually an individual  couple  family  or small group   the various therapeutic approaches and practices are associated with different theoretical perspectives and employ different procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance  explore the nature of psychological problems  and encourage new ways of thinking  feeling  or behaving  four major theoretical perspectives are   psychodynamic psychotherapy psychodynamic      cognitive behavioral therapy cognitive behavioral      humanistic psychology existential humanistic    and systems or   family therapy    there has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches  especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture  gender  spirituality  and sexual orientation  with the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy  there is evidence that most of the major therapies are about of equal effectiveness  with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance    because of this  more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an   integrative psychotherapy eclectic therapeutic orientation

comparative psychology refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non human animals  especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history  adaptive significance  and development of behavior  research in this area addresses many different issues  uses many different methods  and explores the behavior of many different species  from insects to primates  it is closely related to other disciplines that study animal behavior such as   ethology     research in comparative psychology sometimes appears to shed light on human behavior  but some attempts to connect the two have been quite controversial  for example the   sociobiology   of   e  o  wilson     animal models are often used to study neural processes related to human behavior  e g  in   cognitive neuroscience      developmental    mainly focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span    developmental psychology   seeks to understand how people come to perceive

study   child  ren use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks  such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful  and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of infants  in addition to studying children  developmental psychologists also study   aging   and processes throughout the life span  especially at other times of rapid change  such as   adolescence   and   old age     developmental

and psychologists who offer services to the public are usually required to be licensed    qualitative and quantitative research   research in most areas of psychology is conducted in accord with the standards of the   scientific method    psychological researchers seek the emergence of theoretically interesting categories and hypotheses from data  using   qualitative research qualitative   or   quantitative research quantitative   methods  or both    qualitative psychological research   methods include   interview  s  first hand observation  and   participant observation    creswell  2003  identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research  including narrative    phenomenology  psychology  phenomenology      ethnography      case study    and   grounded theory    qualitative researchers  sometimes aim to enrich   hermeneutics interpretations   or   critical theory critiques   of   symbol  s    subject  philosophy  subjective   experiences  or   social structure  s  similar hermeneutic and critical aims have also been served by  quantitative methods   as in   erich fromm   s study of   authoritarian personality nazi voting   or   stanley milgram   s   milgram experiment studies   of   obedience to authority     quantitative psychological research   lends itself to the   statistical   testing of hypotheses  quantitatively oriented research designs include the   experiment      quasi experiment      cross sectional study      case control study    and   longitudinal study    the measurement and   operational definition operationalization   of important constructs is an essential part of these research designs  statistical methods include the   pearson product moment correlation coefficient    the   analysis of variance      multiple linear regression      logistic regression      structural equation modeling    and   hierarchical linear modeling      controlled experiments       experimental psychological research is conducted in a laboratory under controlled conditions  this method of research relies on the application of the   scientific method   to understand behavior  experimenters use several types of measurements  including rate of response    reaction time    and various   psychometric   measurements  experiments are designed to   hypothesis testing test   specific   hypotheses    deductive approach  or evaluate functional relationships  inductive approach   a   true experiment   with   randomized controlled trial random   allocation of subjects to conditions allows researchers to infer causal relationships between different aspects of behavior and the environment  in an experiment  one or more variables of interest are controlled by the experimenter  independent variable  and another variable is measured in response to different conditions  dependent variable   experiments are one of the primary research methods in many areas of psychology  particularly   cognitive psychology cognitive     psychonomics      mathematical psychology      psychophysiology   and   biological psychology     cognitive neuroscience   experiments on humans have been put under some controls  namely informed and voluntary consent  after world war ii  the   nuremberg code   was established because of nazi abuses of experimental subjects  later  most countries  and scientific journals  adopted the   declaration of helsinki    in the u s   the   national institutes of health   established the   institutional review board   in 1966  and in 1974 adopted the   national research act    hr 7724   all of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies  a number of influential studies led to the establishment of this rule  such studies included the   mit   and fernald school radioisotope studies  the   thalidomide scandal thalidomide tragedy    the willowbrook   hepatitis   study  and   stanley milgram   s studies of obedience to authority    survey questionnaires   statistical surveys are used in psychology for measuring attitudes and traits  monitoring changes in mood  checking the validity of experimental manipulations  and for a wide variety of other psychological topics  most commonly  psychologists use paper and pencil surveys  however  surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e mail  increasingly  web based surveys are being used in research  similar methodology is also used in applied setting  such as clinical assessment and personnel assessment    longitudinal studies     longitudinal studies   are often used in psychology to study developmental trends across the life span  and in   sociology   to study life events throughout lifetimes or generations  the reason for this is that unlike   cross sectional studies    longitudinal studies track the same people  and therefore the differences observed in those people are less likely to be the result of cultural differences across generations  because of this benefit  longitudinal studies make observing changes more accurate and they are applied in various other fields because most longitudinal studies are observational  in the sense that they observe the state of the world without manipulating it  it has been argued that they may have less power to detect causal relationships than do experiments  they also suffer methodological limitations such as from selective attrition because people with similar characteristics may be more likely to drop out of the study making it difficult to analyze some longitudinal studies are   experiments    called   repeated measures experiment  s  psychologists often use the   crossover study crossover design   to reduce the influence of   confounding     covariate  s and to   efficiency  statistics  reduce the number of subjects      observation in natural settings     survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head  destroying much of his brain s left frontal lobe  and is remembered for that injury s reported effects on his personality and behavior    just as   jane goodall   studied   chimpanzee   social and family life by careful observation of chimpanzee behavior in the field  psychologists conduct observational studies of ongoing human social  professional  and family life   sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed  and other times the participants do not know they are being observed  strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation is being carried out    qualitative and descriptive research     with two layers  an interconnected group of nodes  akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain   research designed to answer questions about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts  feelings  and behaviors of individuals is known as   descriptive research    descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation    qualitative research   is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur  with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made    neuropsychological methods     used in   behavioral neuroscience   to study the role of the   hippocampus   in   spatial learning   and memory   neuropsychological research methods are employed in studies that examine the relation of mental activity and behavior to the structure and function of the   human brain brain    these methods include testing  e g   the various   david wechsler wechsler scales      wisconsin card sorting test       functional neuroimaging    and   transcranial magnetic stimulation      computational modeling      the subject believes that for each wrong answer  the learner was receiving actual electric shocks  though in reality there were no such punishments  being separated from the subject  the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electro shock generator  which played pre recorded sounds for each shock level etc      computer simulation computational modeling    is a tool often used in   mathematical psychology   and   cognitive psychology   to simulate a particular behavior using a computer  this method has several advantages  since modern computers process information extremely quickly  many simulations can be run in a short time  allowing for a great deal of statistical power  modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn t be directly observed in a human several different types of modeling are used to study behavior    connectionism   uses   neural network  s to simulate the brain  another method is symbolic modeling  which represents many different mental objects using variables and rules  other types of modeling include   dynamic systems   and   stochastic process stochastic   modeling    animal studies   animal experiments aid in investigating many aspects of human psychology  including perception  emotion  learning  memory  and thought  to name a few  in the 1890s  russian physiologist   ivan pavlov   famously used dogs to demonstrate   classical conditioning      animal testing on non human primates non human primates    cats  dogs  pigeons    laboratory rat rats    and other   animal testing on rodents rodents   are often used in psychological experiments  ideally  controlled experiments introduce only one   independent variable   at a time  in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables  these conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings  in contrast  human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely  and depend upon so many factors  that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects  of course  there are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models    criticism     theory   criticisms of psychological research often come from perceptions that it is a  soft  science  philosopher of science   thomas kuhn   s 1962 critique  implied psychology overall was in a pre paradigm state  lacking the agreement on overarching theory found in mature sciences such as   chemistry   and   physics   because some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as surveys and   questionnaire  s  critics have asserted that psychology is not an objective science  other concepts that psychologists are interested in  such as   personality psychology personality      thinking    and   emotion    cannot be directly measured  and are often inferred from subjective self reports  which may be problematic   some critics view   statistical hypothesis testing criticism statistical hypothesis testing   as misplaced  researc has documented that many psychologists confuse   statistical significance   with   effect size practical importance    statistically significant but practically unimportant results are common with large samples   some psychologists have responded with an increased use of   effect size   statistics  rather than sole reliance on the   ronald a  fisher fisherian     p value   p      05     statistical significance significance   criterion  whereby an observed difference is deemed    statistically significant    if an effect of that size or larger would occur with 5   or less    frequency probability probability   in   independence  probability theory  independent     replication  statistics  replications    assuming the truth of the   null hypothesis   of no difference between the treatments    false positive   conclusions  often resulting from the   publish or perish pressure to publish   or the author s own   confirmation bias    are an inherent hazard in the field  requiring a certain degree of   skepticism   on the part of readers  sometimes the debate comes from within psychology  for example between laboratory oriented researchers and practitioners such as clinicians  in recent years  and particularly in the u s   there has been increasing   scientific debate debate   about the nature of therapeutic effectiveness and about the relevance of empirically examining psychotherapeutic strategies     practice   some observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its application in particular  the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practices   critics say there has been an increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence   one skeptic asserts that practices  such as    facilitated communication   for infantile autism   memory recovery techniques including   bodywork  alternative medicine  body work    and other therapies  such as   rebirthing breathwork rebirthing   and   reparenting    may be dubious or even dangerous  despite their popularity   in 1984  allen neuringer made a similar poin regarding the experimental analysis of behavior     ethical standards   current ethical standards of psychology would not permit some studies to be conducted today  these human studies would violate the   human subject research apa ethics code ethics code of the american psychological association    the canadian code of conduct for research involving humans  and the   belmont report    current ethical guidelines state that using non human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm  physical or psychological  done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research   keeping this in mind  psychologists can use on animals research techniques that could not be used on humans   an   milgram experiment experiment   by   stanley milgram   raised questions about the   ethics   of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional stress suffered by the participants  it measured the willingness of study participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts that conflicted with their personal conscience      harry harlow   drew condemnation for his  pit of despair  experiments on   rhesus macaque   monkeys at the   university of wisconsin madison   in the 1970s   the aim of the research was to produce an animal model of   major depressive disorder clinical depression    harlow also devised what he called a  rape rack   to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture   in 1974  american literary critic   wayne c  booth   wrote that   harry harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade  invariably proving what we all knew in advance that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties   he writes that harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work  university psychology departments have ethics committees dedicated to the rights and well being of research subjects  researchers in psychology must gain approval of their research projects before conducting any experiment to protect the interests of human participants and laboratory animals     systemic bias   in 1959 statistician theodore sterling examined the results of psychological studies and discovered that 97  of them supported their initial hypotheses  implying a possible   publication bias       similarly  fanelli  2010   found that 91 5  of psychiatry psychology studies confirmed the effects they were looking for  and concluded that the odds of this happening  a positive result  was around five times higher than in fields such as   space science space    or   geoscience  s  fanelli argues that this is because researchers in  softer  sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases in 2010  a group of researchers reported a systemic bias in psychology studies towards weird   western  educated  industrialized  rich and democratic   subjects   although only 1 8 people worldwide fall into the weird classification  the researchers claimed that 60 90  of psychology studies are performed on weird subjects  the article

prevalence of literature in   ancient china      ancient india      history of iran persia   and   classical antiquity ancient greece and rome    many works of earlier periods  even in narrative form  had a covert moral or didactic purpose  such as the sanskrit     panchatantra     or the     metamorphoses     of ovid    drama   and   satire   also developed as urban culture provided a larger

progressing down to the 4th century ad  in ancient greece  the epics of   homer    who wrote the     iliad     and the     odyssey      and   hesiod    who wrote     works and days     and     theogony      are some of the earliest  and most influential  of ancient greek literature  classical greek genres included philosophy    poetry    historiography    comedies   and   drama  s    plato   and   aristotle   authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of   western philosophy      sappho   and   pindar   were influential   lyrical poetry lyrical poets    and   herodotus   and   thucydides   were early greek historians  although drama was popular in ancient greece  of the hundreds of   tragedy tragedies   written and performed during the   classical age    only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist    aeschylus      sophocles    and   euripides    the plays of   aristophanes   provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as   ancient greek comedy old comedy    the earliest form of greek comedy  and are in fact used to define the genre       germany german   writer and author of the   faust faust books     roman histories and biographies anticipated the extensive mediaeval literature of lives of saints and miraculous chronicles  but the most characteristic form of the   middle ages   was the   romance  heroic literature  romance    an adventurous and sometimes magical narrative with strong popular appeal   controversial  religious  political and instructional literature proliferated during the renaissance as a result of the invention of printing  while the mediaeval romance developed into a more character based and psychological form of narrative  the   novel    of which early and important examples are the chinese   journey to the west monkey   and the german   faust faust books    in the   age of reason   philosophical tracts and speculations on history and human nature integrated literature with social and political developments  the inevitable reaction was the explosion of   romanticism   in the later 18th century which reclaimed the imaginative and fantastical bias of old romances and folk literature and asserted the primacy of individual experience and emotion   but as the 19th century went on  european fiction evolved towards   realism  arts  realism   and   naturalism  literature  naturalism    the meticulous documentation of real life and social trends  much of the output of naturalism was implicitly polemical  and influenced social and political change  but 20th century fiction and drama moved back towards the subjective  emphasising unconscious motivations and social and environmental pressures on the individual  writers such as   marcel proust proust      t s eliot eliot      james joyce joyce      franz kafka kafka   and   luigi pirandello pirandello   exemplify the trend of documenting internal rather than external realities     genre fiction   also showed it could question reality in its 20th century forms  in spite of its fixed formulas  through the enquiries of the skeptical   detective fiction detective   and the alternative realities of   science fiction    the separation of  mainstream  and  genre  forms  including journalism  continued to blur during the period up to our own times    william burroughs    in his early works  and   hunter s  thompson   expanded documentary reporting into strong subjective statements after the   world war ii second world war    and   postmodernism post modern   critics have disparaged the idea of objective realism in general    poetry   a   poem   is a   composition  language  composition   written in   meter  poetry  verse    although verse has also been used for epic and dramatic fiction   poems make use of the  aesthetic qualities of language to suggest differential meanings and to evoke emotive responses  poems rely heavily on   and   metaphor    they may have a rhythmic structure based on patterns of stresses    meter  poetry  metric feet    or on patterns of different length syllables  as in classical   prosody  poetry  prosody     and they may or may not utilize   rhyme    due to the diversity of poetic forms and structures    poetry   can be difficult to define and characterize  typically though  poetry as a form of literature makes use of the   formal   properties of the words it use the properties of the   writing written   or   speech communication spoken   form of the words  independent of their meaning  for example  rhythm can be established by the number of syllables in the words or how these syllables are stressed  rhyme and   alliteration   depend on the sounds of the words arguably  poetry pre dates other forms of literature    early examples include the   sumer  ian     epic of gilgamesh      dated from around   3rd millennium bc 2700 b c      parts of the   bible    the surviving works of   homer    the     iliad     and the     odyssey       and the   indian epic poetry indian epics       ramayana     and     mahabharata      in cultures based primarily on   oral tradition  s the formal characteristics of poetry often have a   mnemonic   function  and important texts  legal    genealogy genealogical   or moral  for example  may appear first in verse form some poetry uses specific forms  examples include the   haiku    the   limerick  poetry  limerick    and the   sonnet    a traditional haiku written in japanese relate to   nature    contain seventeen onji  syllables   distributed over three lines in groups of five  seven  and five  and should also have a kigo  a specific word indicating a season  a limerick has five lines  with a   rhyme scheme   of aabba  and line lengths of 3 3 2 2 3 stressed syllables  it traditionally has a less reverent attitude towards nature  poetry not adhering to a formal poetic structure is called    free verse    language and tradition dictate some poetic norms  persian poetry always rhymes whilst greek poetry rarely does  some languages contain more rhyming words than others  italian  for example  has a rich rhyming structure permitting use of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem  the richness results from word endings that follow regular forms  english  with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages  is less rich in rhyme  perhaps the most   paradigm  atic style of english poetry  blank verse  as exemplified in works by   william shakespeare shakespeare   and   john milton milton    consists of unrhymed   iambic pentameter  s  some languages prefer longer lines  some shorter ones  some of these conventions result from the ease of fitting a specific language s vocabulary and grammar into certain structures  rather than into others  for example  this may occur when a language typically has longer words than other languages  other structural conventions come about as the result of historical accidents  where many speakers of a language associate good poetry with a verse form preferred by a particular skilled or popular poet works for theatre  see below  traditionally took verse form  this has now become rare outside   opera   and   musical theater musicals    although many would argue that the language of drama remains intrinsically poetic in recent years    digital poetry   has arisen that takes advantage of the artistic  publishing  and synthetic qualities of digital media    essays   an   essay   consists of a discussion of a topic from an author s personal point of view  exemplified by works by   michel de montaigne   or by   charles lamb  writer  charles lamb    essay  in english derives from the french word for  to attempt     essayer   thus  one can find open ended  provocative  and inconclusive essays  the term  essays  first applied to the self reflective musings of   michel de montaigne    who has a reputation as the father of this literary formgenres related to the essay may include   the   memoir    saying the story of an author s life from the author s personal point of view  the   epistle    usually a formal  didactic  or elegant   letter  message  letter     works by   murasaki shikibu lady murasaki   the arabic     hayy ibn yaqdhan     by   ibn tufail    the arabic     theologus autodidactus     by   ibn al nafis    and the chinese     romance of the three kingdoms     by   luo guanzhong  early novels in europe did not count as significant litera perhaps because  mere  prose writing seemed easy and unimportant it has become clear  however  that prose writing can provide aesthetic pleasure without adhering to poetic forms  additionally  the freedom authors gain in not having to concern themselves with verse structure translates often into a more complex   plot  narrative  plot   or into one richer in precise detail than one typically finds even in narrative poetry  this freedom also allows an author to experiment with many different literary and presentation styles including poetry in the scope of a single novel    other prose literature     philosophy philosophical      history historical      journalism journalistic    and   natural science scientific   writings are traditionally ranked as literature  they offer some of the oldest prose writings in existence  novels and prose stories earned the names    fiction    to distinguish them from factual writing or   nonfiction    which writers historically have crafted in prose     natural science    as advances and specialization have made new scientific research inaccessible to most audiences  the  literary  nature of science writing has become less pronounced over the last two centuries  now  science appears mostly in   scientific journal journals    scientific works of   aristotle      nicolaus copernicus copernicus    and   isaac newton newton   still possess great value  but since the science in them has largely become outdated  they no longer serve for scientific instruction  yet  they remain too technical to sit well in most programmes of literary study  outside of    history of science    programmes  students rarely read such works     philosophy    philosophy  too  has become an increasingly academic discipline  more of its practitioners lament this situation than occurs with the sciences  nonetheless most new philosophical work appears in   academic publishing academic journals    major philosophers through history   plato      aristotle    socrates    augustine of hippo augustine      ren  descartes descartes      s ren kierkegaard kierkegaard      friedrich nietzsche nietzsche   have become as canonical as any writers  some recent philosophy works are argued to merit the title  literature   such as some of the works by   simon blackburn    but much of it does not  and some areas  such as   logic    have become extremely technical to a degree similar to that of   mathematics       history    a great deal of historical writing ranks as literature  particularly the genre known as   creative nonfiction    so can a great deal of journalism  such as   literary journalism    however these areas have become extremely large  and often have a primarily utilitarian purpose  to record data or convey immediate information  as a result the writing in these fields often lacks a literary quality  although it often and in its better moments has that quality  major  literary  historians include   herodotus      thucydides   and   procopius    all of whom count as canonical literary figures     law      law   offers a less clear case  some writings of   plato   and   aristotle    the law tables of   hammurabi   of   babylon    or even the early parts of the   bible   could be seen as legal literature    roman law roman civil law   as codified in the   corpus juris civilis   during the reign of   justinian i   of the   byzantine empire   has a reputation as significant literature  the founding documents of many countries  including   constitution  s and   law code  s  can count as literature  however  most legal writings rarely exhibit much literary merit  as they tend to be rather   wikt garrulous garrulous     drama     was a

aims at dramatic   theatrical   performance    see   theatre    rather than at reading  during the 18th and 19th centuries    opera   developed as a combination of poetry  drama  and   music    nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently  shakespeare could be considered drama    romeo and juliet    for example  is a classic romantic drama generally accepted as literature   greek

oral literature  the term   oral literature   refers not to written  but to oral traditions  which includes different types of   epic poetry epic      poetry   and   drama      folklore folktale  s    ballad  s  however the use of this   oxymoron   is controversial and not generally accepted by the scientific community  some prefer to avoid the   etymology etymological question   using     oral tradition oral narrative tradition      oral sacred tradition    oral poetry  or directly using epics or poetry  terms that do not necessarily imply writing   others prefer to create neologisms as

genres of literature    literary genre   is a mode of categorising literature  the term originates from french  designating a proposed type or class   however  such classes are subject to change  and have been used in different ways in different periods and traditions   literary techniques  a    literary technique    or    literary device    can be used by authors in order to enhance the written framework of a piece of literature  and produce specific effects  literary techniques encompass a wide range of approaches to crafting a work  whether a work is narrated in   grammatical person first person   or from another perspective  whether to use a traditional linear narrative or a   nonlinear narrative    or the choice of   literary genre    are all examples of literary technique  they may indicate to a reader that there is a familiar structure and presentation to a work  such as a conventional   crime fiction murder mystery novel    or  the author may choose to experiment with their technique to surprise the reader in this way  use of a technique can lead to the development of a new genre  as was the case with one of the first modern novels      pamela  or virtue rewarded pamela     by   samuel richardson      pamela   is written as a collection of letter writing correspondence  called  epistolary technique   by using this technique    pamela   strengthened the tradition of the   epistolary novel    a genre which had been practiced for some time already but without the same acclaim  literary technique is distinguished from   narrative device literary device    as   military tactics   are distinguished from   military strategy    devices are specific constructions within the narrative that make it effective  examples include   metaphor      simile      ellipsis    narrative   motif  narrative  motif  s  and   allegory    even simple   word play   functions as a literary device  the   narrative mode   may be considered a literary device  such as the use of   stream of consciousness narrative   literary criticism implies a critique and evaluation of a piece of literature and  in some cases  it is used to improve a work in progress or a classical piece  as with an ongoing theatre production  literary editors can serve a similar purpose for the authors with whom they work  there are many types of literary criticism and each can be used to critique a piece in a different way or critique a different aspect of a piece   legal status     uk        c  1776  by   jean honor  fragonard      national gallery of art    washington  dc   literary works have

name seems to have originally referred to a native   ancient libya libyan   tribe  however  see   terence biography   for discussion  the name is usually connected with   phoenician language phoenician     afar     dust   but a 1981 hypothesis  has asserted that it stems from the   berber language berber     ifri    plural   ifran     cave   in reference to cave dwellers   the same word

africa  as europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent  the idea of   africa   expanded with their knowledge other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name  africa    the 1st century jewish historian   flavius josephus      ant  1 15    asserted that it was named for   epher    grandson of   abraham   according to gen  25 4  whose descendants  he claimed

cold   africanus suggested that the greek   phrike            cold and horror    combined with the   privative   prefix   alpha privative  a      indicated a land free of cold and horror    another theory is that the word   aphrik    comes from   aphr s     foam  and   aphrik      land of foam   meaning   the land of the big waves    like   attica    from the word   akt       aktik    meaning

was becoming increasingly dry and hostile  the population trekked out of the sahara region towards the nile valley below the   second cataract   where they made permanent or semi permanent settlements  a major climatic recession occurred  lessening the heavy and persistent rains in central and   eastern africa    since this time  dry conditions have prevailed in eastern africa and  increasingly during the last 200 years  in   ethiopia   the domestication of   cattle   in africa preceded   agriculture   and seems to have existed alongside hunter gatherer cultures  it is speculated that by 6000 bc  cattle were already domesticated in north africa   in the sahara nile complex  people domesticated many animals  including the   donkey   and a small screw horned goat which was common from   algeria   to   nubia   in the year 4000 bc  the climate of the sahara started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace   this climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing   desertification    this  in turn  decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of   west africa     and by 500 bc  metalworking began to become commonplace in west africa  ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 bc in many areas of east and west africa  although other regions

western sudan in the 13th century  kanem accepted islam in the 11th century in the forested regions of the west african coast  independent kingdoms grew up with little influence from the   islam muslim   north  the   kingdom of nri   of the igbo was established around the 9th century and was one of the first  it is also one of the oldest kingdoms in modern day   nigeria   and was ruled by the   eze nri    the nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate   igbo ukwu bronzes bronzes    found at the town of   igbo ukwu    the bronzes have been dated from as far back as the 9th century   the   ife    historically the first of these yoruba city states or kingdoms  established government under a priestly   oba  ruler  oba     king  or  ruler  in the   yoruba language     called the   ooni of ife    ife was noted as a major religious and cultural centre in africa  and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture  the ife model of government was adapted at   oyo empire oyo    where its obas or kings  called the   alaafins of oyo    once controlled a large number of other yoruba and non yoruba city states and kingdoms  the   fon people fon     kingdom of   dahomey     was one of the non yoruba domains under oyo control the   almoravid dynasty almoravids   were a   berber people berber   dynasty from the   sahara   that spread over a wide area of northwestern africa and the iberian peninsula during the 11th century   the   banu hilal   and   maqil banu ma qil   were a collection of   arab     bedouin   tribes from the   arabian peninsula   who migrated westwards via egypt between the 11th and 13th centuries  their   human migration migration   resulted in the fusion of the arabs and berbers  where the locals were   arabization arabized     and arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture  under the unifying framework of islam     11th to 15th centuries   following the breakup of mali  a local leader named   sonni ali    1464 1492  founded the   songhai empire   in the region of middle   niger   and the western sudan and took control of the trans saharan trade  sonni ali seized   timbuktu   in 1468 and   djenn  jenne   in 1473  building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of muslim merchants  his successor   askia mohammad i    1493 1528  made islam the official religion  built mosques  and brought to gao muslim scholars  including al maghili  d 1504   the founder of an important tradition of sudanic african muslim scholarship   by the 11th century  some   hausa kingdoms hausa   states   such as   kano      jigawa      katsina    and   gobir     had developed into walled towns engaging in trade  servicing   camel train caravans    and the manufacture of goods  until the 15th century  these small states were on the periphery of the major sudanic empires of the era  paying tribute to songhai to the west and kanem borno to the east    height of slave trade     in   ouidah      benin    a former gateway for slaves to slave ships     slavery   had long been practiced in africa    between the 7th and 20th centuries  arab slave trade  also known as slavery in the east  took 18 million slaves from africa via trans saharan and indian ocean routes  between the 15th and the 19th centuries  500 years   the atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7 12 million slaves to the new world    in   west africa    the decline of the atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities  the gradual decline of slave trading  prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the   new world    increasing   abolitionism anti slavery   legislation in europe and america  and the   royal navy british royal navy s   increasing presence off the west african coast  obliged african states to adopt new economies  between 1808 and 1860  the british   west africa squadron   seized approximately 1 600 slave ships and freed 150 000 africans who were aboard  action was also taken against african leaders who refused to agree to british treaties to outlaw the trade  for example against  the usurping king of   lagos     deposed in 1851  anti slavery treaties were signed with over 50 african rulers   the largest powers of west africa  the   asante confederacy    the   dahomey kingdom of dahomey    and the   oyo empire    adopted different ways of adapting to the shift  asante and dahomey concentrated on the development of  legitimate commerce  in the form of   palm oil      cocoa bean cocoa      timber   and   gold    forming the bedrock of west africa s modern export trade  the oyo empire  unable to adapt  collapsed into civil wars     colonialism and the  scramble for africa      s in 1913  along with modern borders   in the late 19th century  the european   imperialism imperial   powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent  creating many   colony colonial   territories  and leaving only two fully independent states    ethiopia    known to europeans as  abyssinia    and   liberia      egypt   and   sudan   were never formally incorporated into any european colonial empire  however  after the british occupation of 1882  egypt  was effectively under british administration   unilateral declaration of egyptian independence until 1922      berlin conference   the   berlin conference   held in 1884 85 was an important event in the political future of african ethnic groups  it was convened by king   leopold ii of belgium    and attended by the european powers that laid claim to african territories  it sought to bring an end to the scramble for africa by european powers by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence  they set up the political divisions of the continent  by spheres of interest  that exist in africa today    independence struggles   imperial rule by europeans would continue until after the conclusion of world war ii  when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence    african independence movements independence movements in africa   gained momentum following world war ii  which left the major european powers weakened  in 1951    libya    a former italian colony  gained independence  in 1956    tunisia   and   morocco   won their independence from france     ghana   followed suit the next year  march 1957    becoming the first of the sub saharan colonies to be freed  most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade portugal s overseas presence in   sub saharan africa    most notably in   angola  portugal  angola    cape verde    mozambique  portugal  mozambique      portuguese guinea guinea bissau   and s o tom  and pr ncipe  lasted from the 16th century to 1975  after the   estado novo  portugal  estado novo   regime was overthrown in   carnation revolution a military coup in lisbon      rhodesia     unilateral declaration of independence unilaterally declared independence   from the   united kingdom   in 1965  under the   white minority rule white minority   government of   ian smith    but was not internationally recognised as an independent state  as   zimbabwe    until 1980  when black nationalists gained power after a   rhodesian bush war bitter guerrilla war    although   south africa   was one of the first african countries to gain independence  the state remained under the control of the country s white minority through a system of racial segregation known as   south africa under apartheid apartheid   until 1994    post colonial africa   today  africa contains 54 sovereign countries  most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of european colonialism  since colonialism  african states have frequently been hampered by instability  corruption  violence  and   authoritarianism    the vast majority of african states are   republic  s that operate under some form of the   presidential system   of rule  however  few of them have been able to sustain   democracy democratic   governments on a permanent basis  and many have instead cycled through a series of   coup d  tat coups    producing   military dictatorship  s    zaire s longtime dictator  embezzled over  5 billion from his country   great instability was mainly the result of   ethnic nepotism marginalization of ethnic groups    and   political corruption graft under these leaders    for   divide and rule political gain    many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts  some of which had been exacerbated  or even created  by colonial rule  in many countries  the   armed force military   was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order  and it ruled many nations in africa during the 1970s and early 1980s  during the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s  africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential   assassination  s  border and territorial disputes were also common  with the european imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts   cold war   conflicts between the united states and the   soviet union    as well as the policies of the   international monetary fund    also played a role in instability  when a country became independent for the first time  it was often expected to align with one of the two   superpower  s  many countries in   northern africa   received soviet military aid  while many in central and southern africa were supported by the united states  france or both  the 1970s saw an escalation  as newly independent   angola   and   mozambique   aligned themselves with the soviet union  and the west and south africa sought to contain soviet influence by funding insurgency movements  there was a   1984 1985 famine in ethiopia major famine in ethiopia    when hundreds of thousands of people starved  some claimed that marxist soviet policies made the situation worse     the most devastating military conflict in modern independent africa has been the   second congo war    by 2008  this conflict and its aftermath had killed 5 4 million people  since 2003 there has been an ongoing   darfur war conflict in darfur   which has become a humanitarian disaster  another notable tragic event is the 1994   rwandan genocide   in which an estimated 800 000 people were murdered    aids in africa aids   has also been a prevalent issue in post colonial africa in the 21st century  however  the number of armed conflicts in africa has steadily declined  for instance  the civil war in angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years  this has coincided with many countries abandoning communist style command economies and opening up for market reforms  the improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many african nations  mainly from china  which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries  seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline  several african economies are among the world s fasted growing as of 2011  a significant part of this growth can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone

natural philosophy   and a   natural science   that involves the study of   matter    and its   motion  physics  motion   through space and time  along with related concepts such as   energy   and   force     more broadly  it is the general analysis of   nature    conducted in order to understand how the   universe   behaves    physics is one of the oldest   academic discipline  s  perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of   astronomy     over the last two millennia  physics was a part of natural philosophy along with   chemistry    certain branches of   mathematics    and   biology    but during the   scientific revolution   in the 17th century  the   natural science  s emerged as unique research programs in their own right   physics intersects with many   interdisciplinary   areas of research  such as   biophysics   and   quantum chemistry    and the boundaries of physics are not   demarcation problem rigidly defined    new ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences  while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new   technology technologies   that arise from theoretical breakthroughs  for example  advances in the understanding of   electromagnetism   or   nuclear physics   led directly to the development of new products which have dramatically transformed modern day society  such as   television      computer  s    domestic appliance  s  and   nuclear weapon  s  advances in   thermodynamics   led to the development of   industrialization    and advances in   mechanics   inspired the development of   calculus     history     1643 1727      1879 1955      1858 1947         natural philosophy      has its origins in greece during the   archaic greece archaic period     650 bce   480 bce   when   presocratics pre socratic philosophers   like   thales   rejected   methodological naturalism non naturalistic   explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause   they proposed ideas verified by reason and observation and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment   for example   atomism        classical physics      became a separate science when   early modern europe  ans used these experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the   laws of physics        kepler      galileo   and more specifically   isaac newton newton   discovered and unified the different laws of motion    during the industrial revolution  as energy needs increased  so did research  which led to the discovery of new laws in   thermodynamics      chemistry   and   electromagnetics        modern physics      started with the works of   max planck   in   quantum mechanics quantum theory   and   einstein   in   theory of relativity relativity    and continued in   quantum mechanics   pioneered by   werner heisenberg heisenberg      schr dinger   and   paul dirac     philosophy  in many ways  physics stems from   ancient greek philosophy    from   thales    first attempt to characterize matter  to   democritus    deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state  the   ptolemaic astronomy   of a crystalline   firmament    and aristotle s book     physics  aristotle  physics      an early book on physics  which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view   various greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature  physics was known as   natural philosophy   until the late 18th century by the 19th century physics was realized as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences  physics  as with the rest of science  relies on   philosophy of science   to give an adequate description of the scientific method   the scientific method employs     a priori and a posteriori a priori reasoning     as well as     empirical evidence a posteriori     reasoning and the use of   bayesian inference   to measure the validity of a given theory  the development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers  but has also raised new questions  study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics  the philosophy of physics  involves issues such as the nature of   space   and   time      determinism    and metaphysical outlooks such as   empiricism      naturalism  philosophy  naturalism   and   philosophical realism realism    many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work  for instance   laplace    who championed   causal determinism     and   erwin schr dinger    who wrote on   quantum mechanics     the mathematical physicist   roger penrose   has been called a   platonism platonist   by   stephen hawking     a view penrose discusses in his book      the road to reality       hawking refers to himself as an  unashamed reductionist  and takes issue with penrose s views    core theories  though physics deals with a wide variety of systems  certain theories are used by all physicists  each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found correct as an approximation of nature  within a certain domain of validity   for instance  the theory of   classical physics classical   mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects  provided they are much larger than   atom  s and moving at much less than the   speed of light    these theories continue to be areas of active research  and a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as   chaos theory chaos   was discovered in the 20th century  three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by   isaac newton    1642 1727  these central theories are important tools for research into more specialized topics  and any physicist  regardless of his or her specialization  is expected to be literate in them  these include   classical mechanics      quantum mechanics      thermodynamics   and   statistical mechanics      electromagnetism    and   special relativity      classical physics     classical physics   includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognized and well developed before the beginning of the 20th century   classical mechanics      acoustics      optics      thermodynamics    and   electromagnetism      classical mechanics   is concerned with bodies acted on by   force  s and bodies in   motion  physics  motion   and may be divided into   statics    study of the forces on a body or bodies at rest     kinematics    study of motion without regard to its causes   and   analytical dynamics dynamics    study of motion and the forces that affect it   mechanics may also be divided into   solid mechanics   and   fluid mechanics    known together as   continuum mechanics     the latter including such branches as   fluid statics hydrostatics      fluid dynamics hydrodynamics      aerodynamics    and   pneumatics    acoustics  the study of   sound    is often considered a branch of mechanics because sound is due to the motions of the particles of air or other medium through which   sound wave  s can travel and thus can be explained in terms of the laws of mechanics  among the important modern branches of acoustics is   ultrasonics    the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing    optics    the study of   light    is concerned not only with   visible light   but also with   infrared   and   ultraviolet radiation    which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility  e g   reflection  refraction  interference  diffraction  dispersion  and polarization of light    heat   is a form of   energy    the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed  thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy    electricity   and   magnetism   have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century  an   electric current   gives rise to a   magnetic field   and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current    electrostatics   deals with   electric charge  s at rest    classical electromagnetism electrodynamics   with moving charges  and   magnetostatics   with magnetic poles at rest    modern physics     of 1927  with prominent physicists such as   albert einstein      werner heisenberg      max planck      hendrik lorentz      niels bohr      marie curie      erwin schr dinger   and   paul dirac     classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation  while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on the very large or very small scale  for example    atomic physics atomic   and   nuclear physics   studies matter on the smallest scale at which   chemical element  s can be identified  the   particle physics physics of elementary particles   is on an even smaller scale  as it is concerned with the most basic units of matter  this branch of physics is also known as high energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in large   particle accelerator  s  on this scale  ordinary  commonsense notions of space  time  matter  and energy are no longer valid the two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space  time  and matter from that presented by classical physics    quantum mechanics quantum theory   is concerned with the discrete  rather than continuous  nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level  and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena  the   theory of relativity   is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a   frame of reference   that is in motion with respect to an observer  the   special relativity special theory of relativity   is concerned with relative uniform motion in a straight line and the   general relativity general theory of relativity   with accelerated motion and its connection with   gravitation    both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in all areas of modern physics    difference between classical and modern physics    while physics aims to discover universal laws  its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability  loosely speaking  the laws of   classical physics   accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light  outside of this domain  observations do not match their predictions    albert einstein   contributed the framework of   special relativity    which replaced notions of   absolute time and space   with   spacetime   and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light    max planck      erwin schr dinger    and others introduced   quantum mechanics    a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales  later    quantum field theory   unified   quantum mechanics   and   special relativity      general relativity   allowed for a dynamical  curved   spacetime    with which highly massive systems and the large scale structure of the universe can be well described  general relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions  several candidate theories of   quantum gravity   are being developed   relation to other fields    shaped   lava flow   illustrates the application of mathematics in physics in this case    galileo   s   law of falling bodies         prerequisites   mathematics is the language used for compact description of the order in nature  especially the laws of physics  this was noted and advocated by   pythagoras       plato       galileo     and   isaac newton newton   physics theories use mathematics  to obtain order and provide precise formulas    analytic solution precise   or   simulation computer simulation estimated   solutions  quantitative results and predictions  experiment results in physics are numerical measurements  technologies based on mathematics  like   scientific computing computation   have made   computational physics   an active area of research    ontology   is a prerequisite for physics  but not for mathematics  it means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world  while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns  even beyond the real world  thus physics statements are synthetic  while math statements are analytic  mathematics contains hypotheses  while physics contains theories  mathematics statements have to be only logically true  while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data the distinction is clear cut  but not always obvious  for example  mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics  its methods are mathematical  but its subject is physical   the problems in this field start with a    boundary condition math model of a physical situation    and a  math description of a physical law   every math statement used for solution has a hard to find physical meaning  the final mathematical solution has an easier to find meaning  because it is what the solver is looking for physics is a branch of   fundamental science    not   practical science     physics is also called  the fundamental science  because the subject of study of all branches of   natural science   like chemistry  astronomy  geology and biology are constrained by laws of physics     theory and experiment     and   earth   are both in   free fall      is an   electric current    theorists seek to develop   mathematical model  s that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future results  while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena  although theory and experiment are developed separately  they are strongly dependent upon each other  progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a discovery that existing theories cannot explain  or when new theories generate experimentally testable predictions  which inspire new experiments physicists who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called   phenomenology  science  phenomenologists    phenomenologists look at the complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to fundamental theory theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy    electromagnetism   was unified this way   beyond the known universe  the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues   such as   many worlds interpretation parallel universes    a   multiverse    and   higher dimension  s  theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories  they then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions   experiment  al physics informs  and is informed by    engineering   and   technology    experimental physicists involved in   basic research   design and perform experiments with equipment such as   particle accelerator  s and   laser  s  whereas those involved in   applied research   often work in industry  developing technologies such as   mri magnetic resonance imaging  mri    and   transistor  s  feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek areas which are not well explored by theorists     scope and aims     to explain its behavior  the purview of the branch of physics known as   mechanics     physics covers a wide range of   phenomenon phenomena    from   elementary particle  s  such as quarks  neutrinos and electrons  to the largest   superclusters   of galaxies  included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things  therefore physics is sometimes called the    fundamental science      physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena  thus  physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to   root cause  s  and then connect these causes together for example  the   history of china ancient chinese   observed that certain rocks    lodestone    were attracted to one another by some invisible force  this effect was later called   magnetism    and was first rigorously studied in the 17th century  a little earlier than the chinese  the   ancient greece ancient greeks   knew of other objects such as   amber    that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two  this was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century  and came to be called   electricity    thus  physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause  electricity and magnetism   however  further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force   electromagnetism    this process of  unifying  forces continues today  and electromagnetism and the   weak nuclear force   are now considered to be two aspects of the   electroweak interaction    physics hopes to find an ultimate reason    theory of everything    for why nature is as it is  see section      current research current research     below for more information     research fields   contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into   condensed matter physics      atomic  molecular  and optical physics      particle physics      astrophysics      geophysics   and   biophysics    some physics departments also support research in   physics education   since the 20th century  the individual fields of physics have become increasingly   specialization of knowledge specialized    and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers   universalists  such as   albert einstein    1879 1955  and   lev landau    1908 1968   who worked in multiple fields of physics  are now very rare      condensed matter      atoms  confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter  the   bose einstein condensate      condensed matter physics   is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic physical properties of matter   in particular  it is concerned with the  condensed    phase  matter  phases   that appear whenever the number of particles in a system is extremely large and the interactions between them are strong  the most familiar examples of condensed phases are   solid state physics solids   and   liquid  s  which arise from the bonding and   electromagnetic force   between   atom  s   more exotic condensed phases include the   superfluid    and the   bose einstein condensate    found in certain atomic systems at very low   temperature    the   superconductivity superconducting   phase exhibited by   conduction electron  s in certain materials   and the   ferromagnet  ic and   antiferromagnet  ic phases of   spin  physics  spin  s on   crystal lattice atomic lattices    condensed matter physics is by far the largest field of contemporary physics    historically  condensed matter physics grew out of   solid state physics    which is now considered one of its main subfields   the term   condensed matter physics   was apparently coined by   philip warren anderson philip anderson   when he renamed his research group previously   solid state theory   in 1967   in 1978  the division of solid state physics of the   american physical society   was renamed as the division of condensed matter physics   in addition  particle physicists design and develop the high energy   particle accelerator accelerators       particle detector detectors     and   computational particle physics computer programs     necessary for this research  the field is also called  high energy physics  because many elementary particles do not occur naturally  but are created only during high energy   collision  s of other particles  currently  the interactions of elementary particles and   field  physics  fields   are described by the   standard model     the model accounts for the 12 known particles of matter    quark  s and   lepton  s  that interact via the   strong nuclear force strong      weak nuclear force weak    and   electromagnetism electromagnetic     fundamental force  s   the standard model also predicts a particle known as the   higgs boson      nuclear physics   is the field of physics that studies the constituents and interactions of   atomic nuclei     the most commonly known applications of nuclear physics are   nuclear power   generation and   nuclear weapons   technology  but the research has provided application in many fields  including those in   nuclear medicine   and   magnetic resonance imaging      ion implantation   in   materials engineering    and   radiocarbon dating   in   geology   and   archaeology       astrophysics       the   hubble ultra deep field      astrophysics   and   astronomy   are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of   stellar structure      stellar evolution    the origin of the   solar system    and related problems of   physical cosmology cosmology    because astrophysics is a broad subject  astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics  including mechanics  electromagnetism  statistical mechanics  thermodynamics  quantum mechanics  relativity  nuclear and particle physics  and atomic and molecular physics the discovery by   karl jansky   in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of   radio astronomy    most recently  the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration  perturbations and interference from the earth s atmosphere make space based observations necessary for   infrared astronomy infrared      ultraviolet astronomy ultraviolet      gamma ray astronomy gamma ray    and   x

cosmological theories  in the early 20th century    edwin hubble hubble   s discovery that the universe was expanding  as shown by the   hubble diagram    prompted rival explanations known as the   steady state theory steady state   universe and the   big bang   the big bang was confirmed by the success of   big bang nucleosynthesis   and the discovery of the   cosmic microwave background   in 1964  the big bang model rests on two theoretical pillars  albert einstein s general relativity and the   cosmological principle    cosmologists have recently established the   lambda cdm model  cdm model   of the evolution of the universe  which includes   cosmic inflation      dark energy   and   dark matter   numerous possibilities and discoveries are anticipated to emerge from new data from the   fermi gamma ray space telescope   over the upcoming decade and vastly revise or clarify existing models of the   universe      in particular  the potential for a tremendous discovery surrounding dark matter is possible over the next several years   fermi will search for evidence that dark matter is composed of   weakly interacting massive particle  s  complementing similar experiments with

research    particle accelerator  s have begun probing energy scales in the   tev   range  in which experimentalists are hoping to find evidence for the   higgs boson   and   supersymmetry supersymmetric particles    theoretical attempts to unify   quantum mechanics   and   general relativity   into a single theory of   quantum gravity    a program ongoing for over half a century  have not yet been decisively resolved  the current leading candidates are   m theory      superstring theory   and   loop quantum gravity   many   astronomical   and   physical cosmology cosmological   phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily explained  including the existence of   gzk paradox ultra high energy cosmic rays    the   baryon asymmetry    the   accelerating universe acceleration of the

involving   complex systems complexity      chaos theory chaos    or   turbulence   are still poorly understood complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics

matter      chemistry is concerned with atoms and their interactions with other atoms  and particularly with the properties of   chemical bond  s  chemistry is also concerned with the interactions between atoms  or groups of atoms  and various forms of energy  e g  photochemical reactions  changes in phases of matter  separation of mixtures  properties of polymers  etc   chemistry is sometimes called    the central science    because it bridges other   natural sciences   like   physics      geology   and   biology   with each other    chemistry is a branch of   physical science   but   difference between chemistry and physics distinct from physics    the etymology of the word chemistry has been much disputed   the genesis of chemistry can be traced to certain practices  known as   alchemy    which had been practiced for several   millennia   in various parts of the world  particularly the middle east    etymology  the word   chemistry   comes from the word   alchemy    an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry  metallurgy  philosophy  astrology  astronomy  mysticism and medicine  it is commonly thought of as the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold   alchemy  which was practiced around 330  is the study of the composition of waters  movement  growth  embodying  disembodying  drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies    zosimos of panopolis zosimos      an alchemist was called a  chemist  in popular speech  and later the suffix   ry  was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as  chemistry  the word   alchemy   in turn is derived from the   arabic   word al k m                the arabic term is borrowed from the greek       or           this may have    ancient egypt egyptian   origins  many believe that al k m   is derived from        which is in turn derived from the word    chemi    or    kimi     which is the ancient name of   egypt   in   egyptian language egyptian       definition   in retrospect  the definition of chemistry has changed over time  as new discoveries and theories add to the functionality of the science  the term  chymistry   in the view of noted scientist   robert boyle   in 1661  meant the subject of the material principles of mixed bodies   in 1663   chymistry  meant a scientific art  by which one learns to dissolve bodies  and draw from them the different substances on their composition  and how to unite them again  and exalt them to a higher perfection   this definition was used by chemist   christopher glaser    the 1730 definition of the word  chemistry   as used by   georg ernst stahl    meant the art of resolving mixed  compound  or aggregate bodies into their principles  and of composing such bodies from those principles   in 1837    jean baptiste dumas   considered the word  chemistry  to refer to the science concerned with the laws and effects of molecular forces   this definition further evolved until  in 1947  it came to mean the science of substances  their structure  their properties  and the reactions that change them into other substances   a characterization accepted by   linus pauling     more recently  in 1998  the definition of  chemistry  was broadened to mean the study of matter and the changes it undergoes  as phrased by professor   raymond chang  chemist  raymond chang      history  ancient egyptians pioneered the art of synthetic  wet  chemistry up to 4 000 years ago   by 1000 bc ancient civilizations were using technologies that formed the basis of the various branches of chemistry such as  extracting metal from their ores  making pottery and glazes  fermenting beer and wine  making pigments for cosmetics and painting  extracting chemicals from plants for medicine and perfume  making cheese  dying cloth    tanning   leather    saponification rendering fat into soap    making glass  and making   alloy  s like bronze    atomist philosophy was later adopted by   epicurus    341 270 bce    the genesis of chemistry can be traced to the widely observed phenomenon of   combustion burning   that led to   metallurgy   the art and science of processing ores to get metals  e g    history of metallurgy in the indian subcontinent metallurgy in ancient india     the greed for gold led to the discovery of the process for its purification  even though the underlying principles were not well understood it was thought to be a transformation rather than purification  many scholars in those days thought it reasonable to believe that there exist means for transforming cheaper  base  metals into gold  this gave way to alchemy and the search for the   philosopher s stone   which was believed to bring about such a transformation by mere touch    ancient greece greek     atomism   dates back to 440 bc  arising in works by philosophers such as   democritus   and   epicurus    in 50 bc  the   ancient rome roman   philosopher   lucretius   expanded upon the theory in his book     de rerum natura de rerum natura      on the nature of things     unlike modern concepts of science  greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature  with little concern for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments  much of the early development of purification methods is described by   pliny the elder   in his     naturalis historia      a tentative outline is as follows   alchemy in greco roman egypt     642 ce   the earliest western alchemists such as   mary the jewess      cleopatra the alchemist    and   zosimos of panopolis   described early   laboratory equipment    they are estimated to have lived between the first and third centuries     alchemy  islam  islamic alchemy    642 ce   1200   the muslim conquest of egypt  development of alchemy by   j bir ibn hayy n      muhammad ibn zakariya al razi al razi   and others  j bir modifies aristotle s theories  advances in processes and apparatus    european alchemy  1300   present     pseudo geber   builds on arabic chemistry from the 12th century  major advances in the chemical arts shifted from arab lands to western   europe     were medieval   alchemy and chemistry in medieval islam arab and persian scholars    they introduced precise   observation   and controlled   experiment  ation into the field and discovered numerous   chemical substance  s   their works became more widely known in europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries  beginning with the   latin   translation of j bir s   kitab al kimya   in 1144  the contribution of   history of metallurgy in the indian subcontinent indian alchemists and metallurgists   in the development of chemistry was also quite significant    is considered the  father of modern chemistry     for some practitioners alchemy was an intellectual pursuit  and over time they got better at it    paracelsus    1493 1541   for example  rejected the 4 elemental theory  and with only a vague understanding of his chemicals and medicines formed a hybrid of alchemy and science in what was to be called     iatrochemistry      similarly  the influences of philosophers such as   francis bacon sir francis bacon    1561 1626  and   ren  descartes    1596 1650   who demanded more rigor in mathematics and in removing bias from scientific observations  led to a   scientific revolution    in chemistry this began with   robert boyle    1627 1691  who came up with an equation known as   boyle s law   about the characteristics of gaseous state  chemistry came of age when   antoine lavoisier    1743 1794  developed the theory of   conservation of mass   in 1783  and the development of the   atomic theory   by   john dalton   around 1800  the law of conservation of mass resulted in the reformulation of chemistry based on this la and the oxygen theory of combustion  which was largely based on the work of lavoisier  lavoisier s fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effor to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory lavoisier established the consistent use of the chemical balance  used oxygen to overthrow the   phlogiston theory    and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature and made contribution to the modern metric system  lavoisier also worked to translate the archaic and technical language of chemistry into something that could be easily understood by the largely uneducated masses  leading to an increased public interest in chemistry  all these advances in chemistry led to what is usually called the   chemical revolution    the contributions of lavoisier led to what is now called modern chemistry the chemistry that is studied in educational institutions all over the world  it is because of these and other contributions that   antoine lavoisier   is often celebrated as the    people known as the father or mother of something father of modern chemistry      the later discovery of   friedrich w hler   that many natural substances    organic compound  s  can indeed be synthesized in a chemistry   laboratory   also helped the modern chemistry to mature from its infancy  the   discoveries of the chemical elements discovery of the chemical elements   has a long history from the days of alchemy and culminating in the creation of the   periodic table   of the chemical elements by   dmitri mendeleev    1834 1907   and later discoveries of some   synthetic elements     j ns jacob berzelius      joseph priestley      humphry davy      linus pauling      gilbert n  lewis      josiah willard gibbs      robert burns woodward    and   fritz haber   also made notable contributions the year 2011 was declared by the united nations as the international year of chemistry    it was an initiative of the international union of pure and applied chemistry  and of the united nations educational  scientific  and cultural organization and involves chemical societies  academics  and institutions worldwide and relied on individual initiatives to organize local and regional activities   principles of modern chemistry     institute of biochemistry    university of cologne     the current model of atomic structure is the   quantum mechanical model     traditional chemistry starts with the study of   elementary particles      atom  s    molecule  s      chemical substance substance  s   metals    crystal  s and other aggregates of matter  this matter can be studied in solid  liquid  or gas   states of matter states    in isolation or in combination  the   chemical interaction interactions    reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms  leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together  such behaviors are studied in a chemistry   laboratory   the chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of   laboratory glassware    however glassware is not central to chemistry  and a great deal of experimental  as well as applied industrial  chemistry is done without it a   chemical reaction   is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances   the basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms  it can be symbolically depicted through a   chemical equation    which usually involves atoms as subjects  the number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal  when unequal  the transformation by definition is not chemical  but rather a   nuclear reaction   or   radioactive decay     the type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules  known as chemical laws   energy   and   entropy   considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies  chemical substances are classified in terms of their   structure    phase  as well as their   chemical composition  s  they can be analyzed using the tools of   chemical analysis    e g    spectroscopy   and   chromatography    scientists engaged in chemical research are known as   chemists     most chemists specialize in one or more sub disciplines  several   concept  s are essential for the study of chemistry  some of them are     matter   in chemistry    matter   is defined as anything that has   invariant mass rest mass   and   volume    it takes up space   as well as being made up of   particle  s  the particles that make up matter have rest mass as well   not all particles have rest mass  such as the   photon       atom       the   atom   is the basic unit of chemistry  it consists of a dense core called the   atomic nucleus   surrounded by a space called the   electron cloud    the nucleus is made up of positively charged   protons   and   neutrons   that have no charge  while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus  in a neutral atom  the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons the atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the   chemical properties   of the element  such as   electronegativity      ionization potential    preferred   oxidation state   s     coordination number    and preferred types of bonds to form  e g     metallic      ion  ic    covalent        element      of chemical elements  the colors represent different categories of elements  the concept of   chemical element   is related to that of chemical substance  a chemical element is specifically a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom  a chemical element is characterized by a particular number of   proton  s in the   atomic nucleus nuclei   of its atoms  this number is known as the   atomic number   of the element  for example  all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element   carbon    and all atoms with 92 protons in their nuclei are atoms of the element   uranium   although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same number of protons  they may not necessarily have the same number of   neutrons    such atoms are termed   isotopes     in fact several   isotopes   of an element may exist  ninety four different chemical elements or types of atoms based on the number of protons are observed on earth naturally  having at least one isotope that is stable or has a very long half life  a further 18 elements have been recognised by   iupac   after they have been made in the laboratory  the standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the   periodic table    which orders elements by atomic number and groups them by electron configuration  due to its arrangement    periodic table group groups    or columns  and   period  periodic table  periods    or rows  of elements in the table either share several chemical properties  or follow a certain trend in characteristics such as   atomic radius      electronegativity    etc  lists of the elements   list of elements by name by name      list of elements by symbol by symbol    and by   list of elements by number atomic number   are also available     compound       co sub 2  sub    an example of a chemical compound  a   compound   is a pure chemical substance that consists of two or more elements combined together  in a compound  there is a   particular ratio   of atoms of particular   chemical element  s which determines its composition  and a particular   chemical structure organization   which determines its chemical properties  for example    water  molecule  water   is a compound containing   hydrogen   and   oxygen   in the ratio of two to one  with the oxygen atom between the two hydrogen atoms  and an angle of 104 5  between them  compounds are formed and interconverted by   chemical reaction  s     substance    a chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite   chemical composition composition   and set of   chemical properties properties     strictly speaking  a mixture of compounds  elements or compounds and elements is not a chemical substance  but it may be called a chemical  most of the substances we encounter in our daily life are some kind of mixture  for example    earth s atmosphere air    alloys    biomass    etc nomenclature of substances is a critical part of the language of chemistry  generally it refers to a system for naming   chemical compound  s  earlier in the history of chemistry substances were given name by their discoverer  which often led to some confusion and difficulty  however  today the iupac system of chemical nomenclature allows chemists to specify by name specific compounds amongst the vast variety of possible chemicals the standard nomenclature of chemical substances is set by the   international union of pure and applied chemistry    iupac   there are well defined systems in place for naming chemical species    organic compound  s are named according to the   organic nomenclature   system     inorganic compound  s are named according to the   inorganic nomenclature   system   in addition the   chemical abstracts service   has devised a method to index chemical substances  in this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its   cas registry number       molecule      molecule  c sub 8  sub h sub 10  sub n sub 4  sub o sub 2  sub     a   molecule   is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure   chemical substance   that has its unique set of chemical properties  that is  its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances  however  this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules  which is not true of many substances  see below   molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by   covalent bond  s  such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in   lone pair  s thus  molecules exist as electrically neutral units  unlike ions  when this rule is broken  giving the  molecule  a charge  the result is sometimes named a   molecular ion   or a polyatomic ion  however  the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well separated form  such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a   mass spectrograph    charged polyatomic collections residing in solids  for example  common sulfate or nitrate ions  are generally not considered  molecules  in chemistry   molecule  c sub 6  sub h sub 6  sub    the  inert  or   noble gas noble gas elements      helium      neon      argon      krypton      xenon   and   radon    are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit  but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way  identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water  air  and many organic compounds like alcohol  sugar  gasoline  and the various   pharmaceutical  s however  not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules  and indeed most of the solid substances that makes up the solid crust  mantle  and core of the earth are chemical compounds without molecules  these other types of substances  such as   ionic compounds   and   network solids    are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules   per se     instead  these substances are discussed in terms of   formula unit  s or   unit cell  s as the smallest repeating structure within the substance  examples of such substances are mineral salts  such as   table salt     solids like carbon and diamond  metals  and familiar   silica   and   silicate minerals   such as quartz and granite one of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its   molecular structure structure    while the structure of diatomic  triatomic or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial   linear  angular pyramidal etc   the structure of polyatomic molecules  that are constituted of more than six atoms  of several elements  can be crucial for its chemical nature     mole and amount of substance    the   mole  unit  mole   is a unit of measurement that denotes an   amount of substance    also called chemical amount   specifically it is the amount of a   chemical substance substance   that contains as many elementary entities  atoms  molecules or ions  as there are atoms in 0 012 kilogram  or 12 nbsp grams  of   carbon 12    where the carbon 12 atoms are unbound  at rest and in their   ground state     the number of entities per mole is known as the   avogadro constant    and is determined empirically  the currently accepted value is 6 02214179 30 mol sup  1  sup   2007   codata     one way to understand the meaning of the term  mole  is to compare and contrast it to terms such as   dozen    just as one dozen eggs contains 12 individual eggs  one mole contains 6 02214179 30 atoms  molecules or other particles  the term is used because it is much easier to say  for example  1 mole of carbon  than it is to say 6 02214179 30 carbon atoms  and because moles of chemicals represent a scale that is easy to experience the amount of substance of a solute per volume of   solution   is known as amount of substance concentration  or   molarity   for short  molarity is the quantity most commonly used to express the   concentration   of a solution in the chemical laboratory  the most commonly used units for molarity are mol l  the official si units are mol m sup 3  sup      properties       ions and salts       kcl   a salt which is formed due to the attraction of k sup    sup  cations and cl sup    sup  anions  note how the overall charge of the ionic compound is zero   an   ion   is a charged species  an atom or a molecule  that has lost or gained one or more electrons  when an atom loses an electron and thus has more protons than electrons  the atom is a positively charged ion or   cation    when an atom gains an electron and thus has more electrons than protons  the atom is a negatively charged ion or   anion    cations and anions can form a crystalline lattice of neutral   salt  chemistry  salt  s  such as the na sup    sup  and cl sup    sup  ions forming   sodium chloride    or nacl  examples of

phase are often known as   plasma  physics  plasma       acidity and basicity       hbr   pictured  is dissolved in water  it forms the strong acid   hydrobromic acid    a substance can often be classified as an acid or a   base  chemistry  base    there are several different theories which explain acid base behavior  the simplest is   arrhenius acid arrhenius theory    which states than an acid is a substance that produces   hydronium ion  s when it is dissolved in water  and a base is one that produces   hydroxide ion  s when dissolved in water  according to   br nsted lowry acid base theory    acids are substances that donate a positive   hydrogen     ion   to another substance in a chemical reaction  by extension  a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion  a third common theory is   lewis acids and bases lewis acid base theory    which is based on the formation of new chemical bonds  lewis theory explains that an acid is a substance which is capable of accepting a pair of electrons from another substance during the process of bond formation  while a base is a substance which can provide a pair of electrons to form a new bond   according to this theory  the crucial things being exchanged are charges  acid strength is commonly measured by two methods  one measurement  based on the arrhenius definition of acidity  is   ph    which is a measurement of the hydronium ion concentration in a solution  as expressed on a negative   logarithm  ic scale  thus  solutions that have a low ph have a high hydronium ion concentration  and can be said to be more acidic  the other measurement  based on the br nsted lowry definition  is the   acid dissociation constant    k sub a  sub    which measure the relative ability of a substance to act as an acid under the br nsted lowry definition of an acid   that is  substances with a higher k sub a  sub  are more likely to donate hydrogen ions in chemical reactions than those with lower k sub a  sub  values     phase     in addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications chemicals can exist in several phases  for the most part  the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications  however  some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties  a   phase   is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties  over a range of conditions  such as   pressure   or   temperature   physical properties  such as   density   and   refractive index   tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase  the phase of matter is defined by the     phase transition      which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system  instead of changing the bulk conditions sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary  in this case the matter is considered to be in a   supercritical fluid supercritical   state  when three states meet based on the conditions  it is known as a   triple point   and since this is invariant  it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions the most familiar examples of phases are   solid  s    liquid  s  and   gas  es  many substances exhibit multiple solid phases  for example  there are three phases of solid   iron    alpha  gamma  and delta  that vary based on temperature and pressure  a principal difference between solid phases is the   crystal structure    or arrangement  of the atoms  another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the   aqueous   phase  which is the state of substances dissolved in   aqueous solution    that is  in water  less familiar phases include   plasma physics plasmas      bose einstein condensate  s and   fermionic condensate  s and the   paramagnetism paramagnetic   and   ferromagnetism ferromagnetic   phases of   magnet  ic materials  while most familiar phases deal with three dimensional systems  it is also possible to define analogs in two dimensional systems  which has received attention for its relevance to systems in   biology       bonding       na  and   chlorine    cl  to form   sodium chloride    or common table salt  ionic bonding involves one atom taking valence electrons from another  as opposed to sharing  which occurs in covalent bonding  atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another  a chemical bond may be visualized as the   multipole   balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them   more than simple attraction and repulsion  the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom a chemical bond can be a   covalent bond    an   ionic bond    a   hydrogen bond   or just because of   van der waals force    each of these kinds of bonds is ascribed to some potential  these potentials create the   chemical interaction interaction  s which hold atoms together in   molecule  s or   crystal  s  in many simple compounds    valence bond theory    the valence shell electron pair repulsion model    vsepr     and the concept of   oxidation number   can be used to explain molecular structure and composition an ionic bond is formed when a metal loses one or more of its electrons  becoming a positively charged cation  and the electrons are then gained by the non metal atom  becoming a negatively charged anion  the two oppositely charged ions attract one another  and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them  for example    sodium    na   a metal  loses one electron to become an na sup    sup  cation while   chlorine    cl   a non metal  gains this electron to become cl sup    sup   the ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction  and that compound   sodium chloride    nacl   or common table salt  is formed   molecule  ch sub 4  sub    the carbon atom shares a pair of valence electrons with each of the four hydrogen atoms  thus  the octet rule is satisfied for c atom  it has eight electrons in its valence shell  and the duet rule is satisfied for the h atoms  they have two electrons in their valence shells   in a covalent bond  one or more pairs of   valence electron  s are shared by two atoms  the resulting electrically neutral group of bonded atoms is termed a   molecule    atoms will share valence electrons in such a way as to create a   noble gas   electron configuration  eight electrons in their outermost shell  for each atom  atoms that tend to combine in such a way that they each have eight electrons in their valence shell are said to follow the   octet rule    however  some elements like   hydrogen   and   lithium   need only two electron in their outermost shell to attain this stable configuration  these atoms are said to follow the   duet rule    and in this way they are reaching the electron configuration of the noble gas   helium    which has two electrons in its outer shell similarly  theories from   classical physics   can be used to predict many ionic structures  with more complicated compounds  such as   complex  chemistry  metal complexes    valence bond theory is less applicable and alternative approaches  such as the   molecular orbital   theory  are generally used  see diagram on electronic orbitals    reaction      reacts with carbon monoxide to form iron  one of the   chemical element  s  and carbon dioxide   when a chemical substance is transformed as a result of its interaction with another substance or with energy  a chemical reaction is said to have occurred  a   chemical reaction   is therefore a concept related to the  reaction  of a substance when it comes in close contact with another  whether as a mixture or a   solution    exposure to some form of energy  or both  it results in some energy exchange between the constituents of the reaction as well with the system environment which may be designed vessels which are often   laboratory glassware   chemical reactions can result in the formation or   dissociation  chemistry  dissociation   of molecules  that is  molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules  or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules  chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds    redox oxidation  reduction      dissociation  chemistry  dissociation    acid base   neutralization  chemistry  neutralization   and molecular   rearrangement reaction rearrangement   are some of the commonly used kinds of chemical reactions a chemical reaction can be symbolically depicted through a   chemical equation    while in a non nuclear chemical reaction the number and kind of atoms on both sides of the equation are equal  for a nuclear reaction this holds true only for the nuclear particles viz  protons and neutrons  the sequence of steps in which the reorganization of chemical bonds may be taking place in the course of a chemical reaction is called its   reaction mechanism mechanism    a chemical reaction can be envisioned to take place in a number of steps  each of which may have a different speed  many   reaction intermediates   with variable stability can thus be envisaged during the course of a reaction  reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the   chemical kinetics kinetics   and the relative product mix of a reaction  many   chemists physical chemists   specialize in exploring and proposing the mechanisms of various chemical reactions  several empirical rules  like the   woodward hoffmann rules   often come handy while proposing a mechanism for a chemical reaction according to the   iupac   gold book a chemical reaction is a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species    accordingly  a chemical reaction may be an   elementary reaction   or a   stepwise reaction    an additional caveat is made  in that this definition includes cases where the   conformer interconversion of conformers   is experimentally observable  such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by this definition  but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities  i e   microscopic chemical events       redox    redox    red  uction   ox  idation  reactions include all   chemical reaction  s in which atoms have their   oxidation state   changed by either gaining electrons  reduction  or losing electrons  oxidation   substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances are said to be oxidative and are known as   oxidizing agents    oxidants or oxidizers  an oxidant removes electrons from another substance  similarly  substances that have the ability to reduce other substances are said to be reductive and are known as   reducing agents    reductants  or reducers a reductant transfers electrons to another substance  and is thus oxidized itself  and because it  donates  electrons it is also called an electron donor  oxidation and reduction properly refer to a change in oxidation number the actual transfer of electrons may never occur  thus  oxidation is better defined as an increase in   oxidation number    and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number     equilibrium    although the concept of   chemical equilibrium equilibrium   is widely used across sciences  in the context of chemistry  it arises whenever a number of different states of the chemical composition are possible  for example  in a mixture of several chemical compounds that can react with one another  or when a substance can be present in more than one kind of phase a system of chemical substances at equilibrium  even though having an unchanging composition  is most often not   static equilibrium static    molecules of the substances continue to react with one another thus giving rise to a   dynamic equilibrium    thus the concept describes the state in which the parameters such as chemical composition remain unchanged over time     energy    in the context of chemistry  energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its   atomic structure atomic      molecular structure molecular   or aggregate   chemical structure structure    since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structures  it is invariably accompanied by an   endothermic reaction increase   or   exothermic reaction decrease   of   energy   of the substances involved  some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of   heat   or   photochemistry light    thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants a reaction is said to be   exergonic reaction exergonic   if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state  in the case of   endergonic reaction  s the situation is the reverse  a reaction is said to be   exothermic reaction exothermic   if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings  in the case of   endothermic reaction  s  the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings chemical reactions are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the   activation energy    the   speed   of a chemical reaction  at given temperature t  is related to the activation energy e  by the boltzmann s population factor  math e   e kt    math    that is the probability of a molecule to have energy greater than or equal to e at the given temperature t  this exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the   arrhenius equation   the activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction to occur can be in the form of heat  light    electricity   or mechanical   force   in the form of   ultrasound    a related concept   thermodynamic free energy free energy    which also incorporates entropy considerations  is a very useful means for predicting the feasibility of a reaction and determining the state of equilibrium of a chemical reaction  in   chemical thermodynamics    a reaction is feasible only if the total change in the   gibbs free energy   is negative   math   delta g  le 0     math   if it is equal to zero the chemical reaction is said to be at   chemical equilibrium equilibrium   there exist only limited possible states of energy for electrons  atoms and molecules  these are determined by the rules of   quantum mechanics    which require   quantization  physics  quantization   of energy of a bound system  the atoms molecules in a higher energy state are said to be excited  the molecules atoms of substance in an excited energy state are often much more reactive  that is  more amenable to chemical reactions the phase of a substance is invariably determined by its energy and the energy of its surroundings  when the   intermolecular force  s of a substance are such that the energy of the surroundings is not sufficient to overcome them  it occurs in a more ordered phase like liquid or solid as is the case with water  h sub 2  sub o   a liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by   hydrogen bonds     whereas   hydrogen sulfide    h sub 2  sub s  is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure  as its molecules are bound by weaker   dipole dipole interaction  s the transfer of energy from one chemical substance to another depends on the   size   of energy   quantum quanta   emitted from one substance  however  heat energy is often transferred more easily from almost any substance to another because the   phonons   responsible for vibrational and rotational energy levels in a substance have much less energy than   photons   invoked for the electronic energy transfer  thus  because vibrational and rotational energy levels are more closely spaced than electronic energy levels  heat is more easily transferred between substances relative to light or other forms of electronic energy  for example  ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation is not transferred with as much efficacy from one substance to another as thermal or electrical energy the existence of characteristic energy levels for different   chemical substance  s is useful for their identification by the analysis of   spectral lines    different kinds of spectra are often used in chemical   spectroscopy    e g    infrared spectroscopy ir      microwave spectroscopy microwave      nmr      electron spin resonance esr    etc  spectroscopy is also used to identify the composition of remote objects   like stars and distant galaxies   by analyzing their radiation spectra    the term   energy chemical energy chemical energy   is often used to indicate the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a transformation through a   chemical reaction   or to transform other chemical substances    chemical laws   chemical reactions are governed by certain laws  which have become fundamental concepts in chemistry  some of them are  div style   moz column count 2  column count 2       avogadro s law      beer lambert law      boyle s law    1662  relating pressure and volume     charles s law    1787  relating volume and temperature     fick s law of diffusion      gay lussac s law    1809  relating pressure and temperature     le chatelier s principle      henry s law      hess s law      conservation of energy law of conservation of energy   leads to the important concepts of   chemical equilibrium equilibrium      thermodynamics    and   chemical kinetics kinetics       law of conservation of mass   continues to be conserved in   isolated system  s  even in modern physics  however    special relativity   shows that due to   mass energy equivalence    whenever non material  energy   heat  light  kinetic energy  is removed from a non isolated system  some mass will be lost with it  high energy losses result in loss of weighable amounts of mass  an important topic in   nuclear chemistry       law of definite composition    although in many systems  notably biomacromolecules and minerals  the ratios tend to require large numbers  and are frequently represented as a fraction     law of multiple proportions      raoult s law    div   practice     subdisciplines   chemistry is typically divided into several major sub disciplines  there are also several main cross disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry      analytical chemistry   is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their   chemical composition   and   chemical structure structure    analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry  these methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry  excluding purely theoretical chemistry     biochemistry   is the study of the   chemical compound chemicals      chemical reaction  s and   chemical interaction  s that take place in living   organism  s  biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related  as in   medicinal chemistry   or   neurochemistry    biochemistry is also associated with   molecular biology   and   genetics       inorganic chemistry   is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds  the distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap  most importantly in the sub discipline of   organometallic chemistry       materials science materials chemistry   is the preparation  characterization  and understanding of substances with a useful function  the field is a new breadth of study in graduate programs  and it integrates elements from all classical areas of chemistry with a focus on fundamental issues that are unique to materials  primary systems of study include the chemistry of condensed phases  solids  liquids    polymers    and   interface  chemistry  interfaces   between different phases     neurochemistry   is the study of neurochemicals  including transmitters  peptides  proteins  lipids  sugars  and nucleic acids  their interactions  and the roles they play in forming  maintaining  and modifying the nervous system     nuclear chemistry   is the study of how subatomic particles come together and make nuclei  modern   nuclear transmutation transmutation   is a large component of nuclear chemistry  and the   table of nuclides   is an important result and tool for this field     organic chemistry   is the study of the structure  properties  composition  mechanisms  and   chemical reaction reactions   of   organic compound  s  an organic compound is defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton     physical chemistry   is the study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes  in particular  the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists  important areas of study include   chemical thermodynamics      chemical kinetics      electrochemistry      statistical mechanics      spectroscopy    and more recently    astrochemistry      physical chemistry has large overlap with   molecular physics    physical chemistry involves the use of   calculus infinitesimal calculus   in deriving equations  it is usually associated with   quantum chemistry   and theoretical chemistry  physical chemistry is a distinct discipline from   chemical physics    but again  there is very strong overlap     theoretical chemistry   is the study of chemistry via fundamental theoretical reasoning  usually within   mathematics   or   physics     in particular the application of   quantum mechanics   to chemistry is called   quantum chemistry    since the end of the   world war ii second world war    the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of   computational chemistry    which is the art of developing and applying   computer program  s for solving chemical problems  theoretical chemistry has large overlap with  theoretical and experimental    condensed matter physics   and   molecular physics   other disciplines within chemistry are traditionally grouped by the type of matter being studied or the kind of study  these include   inorganic chemistry    the study of   inorganic   matter    organic chemistry    the study of   organic compound organic    carbon based  matter    biochemistry    the study of   chemical substance substances   found in   organisms biological organisms      physical chemistry    the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as   thermodynamics   and   quantum mechanics    and   analytical chemistry    the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their   chemical composition   and   chemical structure structure    many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years  e g    neurochemistry   the chemical study of the   nervous system    see

philosophy of chemistry   is the scientific study of human   society    and its origins  development  organizations  and   institution  s   it is a   social science   which uses various methods of   empirical method empirical investigation     while ancient philosophers such as   confucius   wrote on the importance of social roles  there is evidence of early sociology in medieval islam  some consider   ibn khaldun    a 14th century   arab     islamic   scholar from north africa  to have been the first sociologist  his     muqaddimah     was perhaps the first work to advance social scientific reasoning on   social cohesion   and   social conflict     the word     wiktionary sociology sociology      or    sociologie     is derived from both latin and greek origins  the   latin   word      wiktionary socius socius       companion      ology     the study of   and in   greek language greek     wiktionary                  l gos     word    knowledge   it was first coined in 1780 by the french essayist   emmanuel joseph siey s    1748 1836  in an unpublished   manuscript     sociology was later defined independently by the french   philosopher of science      auguste comte    1798 1857   in 1838   comte used this term to describe a new way of looking at society   comte had earlier used the term  social physics   but that had subsequently been appropriated by others  most notably the belgian statistician   adolphe quetelet    comte endeavored to unify history  psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm  writing shortly after the malaise of the   french revolution    he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological   positivism    an epistemological approach outlined in     the course in positive philosophy      1830 1842  and     a general view of positivism      1848   comte believed a   law of three stages positivist stage   would mark the final era  after conjectural   theological   and   metaphysics metaphysical   phases  in the progression of human understanding     1798 1857      1818 1883   both   auguste comte   and   karl marx   set out to develop scientifically justified systems in the wake of european   industrialization   and   secularization    informed by various key movements in the   philosophy of history philosophies of history     philosophy of science and science    marx rejected comtean positivismbut in attempting to develop a   science of society   nevertheless came to be recognized as a founder of sociology as the word gained wider meaning  for   isaiah berlin    marx may be regarded as the  true father  of modern sociology   in so far as anyone can claim the title      1820 1903     herbert spencer    27 april 1820 nbsp   8 december 1903  was one of the most popular and influential 19th century sociologists  it is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime  far more than any other sociologist at the time  so strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers  including    mile durkheim    defined their ideas in relation to his  durkheim s     division of labour in society     is to a large extent an extended debate with spencer from whose sociology  many commentators now agree  durkheim borrowed extensively   for durkheim  sociology could be described as the  science of   institution  s  their genesis and their functioning   durkheim s seminal monograph      suicide  book  suicide      1897   a case study of suicide rates amongst   catholic   and   protestant   populations  distinguished sociological analysis from   psychology   or philosophy  it also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of   structural functionalism    by carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts  he attempted to demonstrate that catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of protestants  something he attributed to social  as opposed to individual or   psychological    causes  he developed the notion of objective   suis generis    social facts  to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study   the field predominated in   continental europe    with british   anthropology   and   statistics   generally following on a separate trajectory  by the turn of the 20th century  however  many theorists were active in the   anglo saxon world    few early sociologists were confined strictly to the subject  interacting also with   economics      jurisprudence    psychology and   philosophy    with theories being appropriated in a variety of different fields  since its inception  sociological epistemologies  methods  and frames of inquiry  have significantly expanded and diverged   in 1883   lester f  ward    the first president of the american sociological association  published   dynamic sociology or applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences   and attacked the laissez faire sociology of   herbert spencer   and sumner   their influence gave rise to   social psychology   and the   symbolic interactionism   of the modern   chicago school  sociology  chicago school     the     american journal of sociology     was founded in 1895  followed by the     american sociological association      asa  in 1905  the first sociology department to be established in the united kingdom was at the   london school of economics london school of economics and political science    home of the     british journal of sociology      in 1904      harriet martineau    an english translator of comte  has been cited as the first female sociologist   in 1909 the   deutsche gesellschaft f r soziologie      german sociological association    was founded by   ferdinand t nnies   and max weber  among others  weber established the first department in germany at the   ludwig maximilian university of munich   in 1919  having presented an influential new   antipositivist   sociology    positivism and anti positivism     positivism   the overarching   methodology methodological   principle of   positivism   is to conduct sociology in broadly the same manner as   natural science    an emphasis on   empiricism   and the   scientific method   is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research based on the assumption that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge  and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology the term has long since ceased to carry this meaning  there are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism  at the turn of the 20th century the first generation of german sociologists formally introduced methodological   anti positivism    proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural   norm  sociology  norm  s    value  personal and cultural  values      symbol  s  and social processes viewed from a resolutely   subject  philosophy  subjective   perspective    max weber   argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify   causality causal relationships   of human    social action    especially among    ideal type  s   or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena   both weber and   georg simmel   pioneered the      verstehen       or  interpretative   method in social science  a systematic process by which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group  or indigenous people  on their own terms and from their own point of view   through the work of simmel  in particular  sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data collection or grand  deterministic systems of structural law  relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime  simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the   phenomenology  philosophy  phenomenological   and   existentialism existential   writers than of comte or durkheim  paying particular concern to the forms of  and possibilities for  social individuality     theoretical frameworks  the contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi paradigmatic    modern sociological theory descends from the historical foundations of functionalist  durkheim  and conflict centered  marx  accounts of social structure  as well as the micro scale structural    georg simmel simmel    and   pragmatism pragmatist      george herbert mead mead    theories of social interaction   contemporary sociological theory retains traces of these approaches presently  sociological theories lack a single overarching foundation  and there is little consensus about what such a framework should consist of   classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of   social evolutionism    as   anthony giddens giddens   states   functionalist thought  from comte onwards  has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science  biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analyzing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation     functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre eminence of the social world over its individual parts  i e  its constituent actors  human subjects       conflict theory   functionalism aims only toward a general perspective from which to conduct social science  methodologically  its principles generally contrast those approaches that emphasize the   microsociology  micro     such as   verstehen interpretivism   or   symbolic interactionism    its emphasis on  cohesive systems   however  also holds political ramifications  functionalist theories are often therefore contrasted with  conflict theories  which critique the overarching socio political system or emphasize the inequality of particular groups  the works of durkheim and marx epitomize the political  as well as theoretical  disparities  between functionalist and conflict thought respectively    20th century social theory      the functionalist movement reached its crescendo in the 1940s and 1950s  and by the 1960s was in rapid decline  the   structural linguistics structuralist   movement originated from the   linguistics linguistic   theory of   ferdinand de saussure   and was later expanded to the social sciences by theorists such as   claude l vi strauss    in this context   structure  refers not to  social structure  but to the   semiotic   understanding of human culture as a   sign  semiotics  system of signs    one may delineate four central tenets of structuralism  first  structure is what determines the structure of a whole  second  structuralists believe that every system has a structure  third  structuralists are interested in  structural  laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes  finally  structures are the  real things  beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning    post structuralist   thought has tended to   antihumanism reject  humanist  assumptions   in the conduct of   social     theory       michel foucault   provides a potent critique in his     the order of things archaeology of the human sciences      though habermas and   richard rorty rorty   have both argued that foucault merely replaces one such system of thought with another    the dialogue between these intellectuals highlights a trend in recent years for certain schools of sociology and philosophy to intersect  the   anti humanist   position has been associated with    postmodernism     a term used in specific contexts to describe an   era   or   phenomena    but occasionally construed as a   method     structure and agency  structure and agency  form an enduring ontological debate in social theory   do social structures determine an individual s behaviour or does human agency   in this context    agency  sociology  agency    refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices  whereas    social structure structure    relates to  factors which limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals  such as social class  religion  gender  ethnicity  and so on   discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological   epistemology     what is the social world made of     what is a cause in the social world  and what is an effect        atlas ti    or   qda miner       experimental research    the researcher isolates a single social process and reproduces it in a laboratory  for example  by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgments are possible   seeking to determine whether or not certain social   dependent and independent variables variables   can cause  or depend upon  other variables  for instance  seeing if people s feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender   stereotype  s    data acquired through these techniques may be analyzed either quantitatively or qualitatively     survey research    the researcher gathers data using interviews  questionnaires  or similar feedback from a set of people sampled from a particular population of interest  survey items from an interview or questionnaire may be open ended or closed ended   data from surveys is usually analyzed statistically on a computer    computational sociology     diagram  individuals  or  nodes   connected by relationships

social phenomena   using   computer simulation  s    artificial intelligence      text mining    complex statistical methods  and new analytic approaches like   social network   analysis

objectified in the course of history    the sociology of law refers to both a sub discipline of sociology and an approach within the field of legal studies  sociology of law is a diverse field of study which examines the interaction of law with other aspects of society  such as the development of legal   institution  s and the effect of laws on social change and vice versa  for example  an influential recent work in the field relies on statistical analyses to argue that the increase in incarceration in the us over the last 30 years is due to changes in law and policing and not to an increase in crime  and that this increase significantly contributes to maintaining racial   social stratification stratification      how to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods  is also a concern    social psychology   of gender  on the other hand  uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification  for example  one recent study has shown that resume evaluators penalize women for motherhood while giving a boost to men for fatherhood   another set of experiments showed that men whose sexuality is questioned compensate by expressing a greater desire for military intervention and sport utility vehicles as well as a greater opposition to gay marriage     health and illness   the sociology of health and illness focuses on the social effects of  and public attitudes toward    illness  es    disease  s    disabilities   and the   aging   process  medical sociology  by contrast  focuses on the inner workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions  in britain  sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the goodenough report  1944    the sociology of the internet in the broad sense regards the analysis of   online communities    e g    newsgroup  s  social networking sites  and   virtual world  s  online communities may be studied statistically through   social network network analysis   or interpreted qualitatively through   virtual ethnography    organizational change is catalyzed through   new media    thereby influencing social change at large  perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an   industrial society industrial   to an   informational society    one notable text is   manuel castells        the internet galaxy     the title of which forms an inter textual reference to   marshall mcluhan   s     the gutenberg galaxy         knowledge and science   the sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises  and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies  the term first came into widespread use in the 1920s  when a number of german speaking theorists  most notably   max scheler    and   karl mannheim    wrote extensively on it  with the dominance of   structural functionalism functionalism   through the middle years of the 20th century  the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought  it was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s  particularly by   peter l  berger   and   thomas luckmann   in     the social construction of reality      1966  and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society  compare     socially constructed reality       the  archaeological  and  genealogical  studies of   michel foucault   are of considerable contemporary influence the sociology of science involves the study of science as a social activity  especially dealing  with the social conditions and effects of science  and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity    in this respect questions of political opinion formation brought about some of the pioneering uses of statistical   survey research   by   paul lazarsfeld     a major subfield of political sociology developed in relation to such questions  which draws on comparative history to analyze socio political trends  the field developed from the work of   max weber   and   moisey ostrogorsky    contemporary political sociology includes these areas of research  but it has been opened up to wider questions of power and politics    today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another  the politics of who knows how and with what authority  and questions of how power is contested in social interactions in such a way as to bring about widespread cultural and social change   such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively   the study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power     race and ethnic relations   the sociology of race and of ethnic relations is the area of the discipline that studies the   social relation social    political  and economic relations between   race  classification of human beings  races   and   ethnicities   at all levels of society  this area encompasses the study of   racism      residential segregation    and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups  this research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as   social stratification stratification   and   social psychology  sociology  social psychology    as well as with   postcolonial theory    at the level of political policy  ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either   assimilationism   or   multiculturalism       anti racism   forms another style of policy  particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s    religion   the sociology of religion concerns the practices  historical backgrounds  developments  universal themes and roles of religion in society   there is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history  the sociology of religion is distinguished from the   philosophy of religion   in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth claims  instead assuming what   peter l  berger   has described as a position of  methodological atheism    it may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology   began   with the analysis of religion in durkheim s 1897   suicide  book  study of suicide   rates amongst   roman catholic   and   protestant   populations  max weber published four major texts on religion in a context of   economic sociology   and his   rationalization  sociology  rationalization thesis        the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism      1905       the religion of china  confucianism and taoism      1915       the religion of india  the sociology of hinduism and buddhism      1915   and     ancient judaism  book  ancient judaism      1920   contemporary debates often center on topics such as   secularization      civil religion    and the role of religion in a context of   globalization   and   multiculturalism      social networks      a social network is a   social structure   composed of individuals  or organizations  called  nodes   which are tied  connected  by one or more specific types of   interdependency    such as   friendship      kinship    financial exchange  dislike    sexual network sexual relationships    or relationships of beliefs  knowledge or prestige  social networks operate on many levels  from families up to the level of nations  and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved  organizations are run  and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals  social network analysis makes no assumption that groups are the building blocks of society  the approach is open to studying less bounded social systems  from non local   communities   to networks of exchange  rather than treating individuals  persons  organizations  states  as discrete units of analysis  it focuses on how the structure of ties affects individuals and their relationships  in contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behavior  network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms  unlike most other areas of sociology  social network theory is usually defined in   mathematical sociology formal mathematics      social psychology   sociological social psychology focuses on micro scale   social actions    this area may be described as adhering to  sociological miniaturism   examining whole societies through the study of individual thoughts and emotions as well as behavior of small groups   modern   western culture western societies   stratification traditionally relates to cultural and economic classes arranged in three main layers    upper class      middle class    and   lower class    but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes  e g    occupational prestige occupational      weber differs from marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification  weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own  marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat     2  prestige  status   a person s prestige  or popularity in a society  this could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth   and  3  power  political party   a person s ability to get their way despite the resistance of others  for example  individuals in state jobs  such as an employee of the federal bureau of investigation  or a member of the united states congress  may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power    pierre bourdieu   provides a modern example in the concepts of   cultural capital cultural   and   symbolic capital    theorists such as   ralf dahrendorf   have noted the tendency toward an enlarged middle class in modern western societies  particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service based economies   perspectives concerning globalization  such as   dependency theory    suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the   third world       urban and rural sociology   urban sociology involves the analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas  it is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making  after the   industrial revolution    works such as   georg simmel   s     the metropolis and mental life      1903  focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity  in the 1920s and 1930s the   chicago school  sociology  chicago school   produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city  important to both urban sociology and criminology  utilising   symbolic interactionism   as a method of field research  contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of   globalization    for instance  in   saskia sassen   s study of the    global city      rural sociology  by contrast  is the analysis of non metropolitan areas    work and industry   the sociology of work  or industrial sociology  examines  the direction and implications of trends in   technological   change    globalization    labour markets  work organization    managerial   practices and   division of labour employment relations   to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge  resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions     sociology and the other academic disciplines  sociology overlaps with a variety of disciplines that study society  in particular   anthropology      political science      economics    and   social philosophy    many comparatively new fields such as   communication studies      cultural studies      demography   and   literary theory    draw upon methods that originated in sociology  the terms    social science    and    social research    have both gained a degree of autonomy since their origination in classical sociology  the distinct field of   social psychology   emerged from the many intersections of sociological and psychological interests  and is further distinguished in terms of   social psychology  sociology  sociological   or   social psychology  psychology  psychological emphasis    sociology and   applied sociology   are connected to the professional and academic discipline of   social work      irving louis horowitz    in his   the decomposition of sociology    1994   has argued that the discipline  whilst arriving from a  distinguished lineage and tradition   is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making   the decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking  and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian

while larger businesses  or those with wider ownership or more formal structures  will usually tend to be organized as corporations or  less often  partnerships  in addition  a business that wishes to raise money on a   stock market   or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so      the sector and country     private profit making businesses are different from government owned bodies  in some countries  certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways     limited liability company limited liability companies  llc     limited liability partnerships  and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from   business failure   by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections  in contrast  unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not so protected        tax advantage  s     different structures are treated differently in tax law  and may have advantages for this reason      disclosure and compliance requirements     different business structures may be required to make less or more information public  or report it to relevant authorities   and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership  either formed with or without limited liability   most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant secretary of state or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations  the relationships and legal rights of   shareholder  s  limited partners  or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized  generally speaking  shareholders in a corporation  limited partners in a limited partnership  and members in a limited liability company are shielded from   personal liability   for the debts and obligations of the entity  which is legally treated as a separate  person   this means that unless there is misconduct  the owner s own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle  they will be treated as a general partnership  the terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created  and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located  no paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership  and without an agreement  the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located a single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a   sole proprietor    whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity a few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include   general partners in a partnership  other than a limited liability partnership   plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity  are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business   generally  corporations are required to pay tax just like  real  people  in some tax systems  this can give rise to so called   double taxation    because first the corporation pays tax on the profit  and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners  individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns  at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed   in most countries  there are laws which treat small corporations differently than large ones  they may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws  have simplified procedures in specialized areas  and have simplified  advantageous  or slightly different tax treatment   to  go public   sometimes called   initial public offering ipo       which basically means to allow a part of the business to be owned by a wider range of investors or the public in general you must organize a separate entity  which is usually required to comply with a tighter set of laws and procedures  most public entities are corporations that have sold shares  but increasingly there are also public llcs that sell units  sometimes also called shares   and other more exotic entities as well  for example    real estate investment trust  s in the usa    unit trust  s in the uk   however  you cannot take a general partnership  public     commercial law     main commercial law    downtown financial district  most commercial transactions are governed by a very detailed and well established body of rules that have evolved over a very long period of time  it being the case that governing trade and commerce was a strong driving force in the creation of law and courts in   western civilization   as for other laws that regulate or affect businesses  in many countries it is all but impossible to chronicle them all in a single reference source  there are laws governing treatment of labour and generally relations with employees  safety and protection issues    health and safety     anti discrimination laws  age  gender  disabilities  race  and in some jurisdictions  sexual orientation   minimum wage laws    trade union union   laws  workers compensation laws  and annual vacation or working hours time in some specialized businesses  there may also be licenses required  either due to special laws that govern entry into certain trades  occupations or professions  which may require special education  or by local governments  professions that require special licenses range from law and medicine to flying airplanes to selling liquor to radio broadcasting to selling investment securities to selling used cars to roofing  local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business without regard to the type of business involved some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation  these industries include  for example    public utility public utilities    investment securities  banking  insurance    broadcasting      aviation    and health care providers

regulations that affect business today  in fact  these laws have become so numerous and complex  that no business lawyer can learn them all  forcing increasing specialization among corporate attorneys

secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law  because of the nature of intellectual property  a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors  many countries are signatories to international   treaty treaties   concerning intellectual property  and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound

tend to be organized as corporations or  less often  partnerships  in addition  a business that wishes to raise money on a   stock market   or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so      the sector and country     private profit making businesses are different from government owned bodies  in some countries  certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways     limited liability company limited liability companies  llc     limited liability partnerships  and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from   business failure   by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections  in contrast  unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not so protected        tax advantage  s     different structures are treated differently in tax law  and may have advantages for this reason      disclosure and compliance requirements     different business structures may be required to make less or more information public  or report it to relevant authorities   and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership  either formed with or without limited liability   most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant secretary of state or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations  the relationships and legal rights of   shareholder  s  limited partners  or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized  generally speaking  shareholders in a corporation  limited partners in a limited partnership  and members in a limited liability company are shielded from   personal liability   for the debts and obligations of the entity  which is legally treated as a separate  person   this means that unless there is misconduct  the owner s own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle  they will be treated as a general partnership  the terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created  and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located  no paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership  and without an agreement  the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located a single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a   sole proprietor    whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity a few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include   general partners in a partnership  other than a limited liability partnership   plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity  are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business   generally  corporations are required to pay tax just like  real  people  in some tax systems  this can give rise to so called   double taxation    because first the corporation pays tax on the profit  and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners  individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns  at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed   in most countries  there are laws which treat small corporations differently than large ones  they may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws  have simplified procedures in specialized areas  and have simplified  advantageous  or slightly different tax treatment   to  go public   sometimes called   initial public offering ipo       which basically means to allow a part of the business to be owned by a wider range of investors or the public in general you must organize a separate entity  which is usually required to comply with a tighter set of laws and procedures  most public entities are corporations that have sold shares  but increasingly there are also public llcs that sell units  sometimes also called shares   and other more exotic entities as well  for example    real estate investment trust  s in the usa    unit trust  s in the uk   however  you cannot take a general partnership  public     commercial law     downtown financial district  most commercial transactions are governed by a very detailed and well established body of rules that have evolved over a very long period of time  it being the case that governing trade and commerce was a strong driving force in the creation of law and courts in   western civilization   as for other laws that regulate or affect businesses  in many countries it is all but impossible to chronicle them all in a single reference source  there are laws governing treatment of labour and generally relations with employees  safety and protection issues    health and safety     anti discrimination laws  age  gender  disabilities  race  and in some jurisdictions  sexual orientation   minimum wage laws    trade union union   laws  workers compensation laws  and annual vacation or working hours time in some specialized businesses  there may also be licenses required  either due to special laws that govern entry into certain trades  occupations or professions  which may require special education  or by local governments  professions that require special licenses range from law and medicine to flying airplanes to selling liquor to radio broadcasting to selling investment securities to selling used cars to roofing  local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business without regard to the type of business involved some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation  these industries include  for example    public utility public utilities    investment securities  banking  insurance    broadcasting      aviation    and health care providers  environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many kinds of businesses in unexpected ways

bombay stock exchange   india  and so on  most countries with capital markets have at least one businesses that have gone  public  are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance  such as how executive officers  compensation is determined  and when and how information is disclosed to the public and their shareholders  in the united states  these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the united states securities and exchange commission  sec   other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies  the regulations are implemented and enforced by the china securities regulation commission  csrc   in china  in singapore  the regulation authority is monetary authority of singapore  mas   and in hong kong  it is securities and futures commission  sfc  as noted at the beginning  it is impossible to enumerate all of the types of laws and regulations that affect business today  in fact  these laws have become so numerous and complex  that no business lawyer can learn them all  forcing increasing specialization among corporate attorneys  it is not unheard of for teams of 5 to 10 attorneys to be required to handle certain kinds of corporate transactions  due to the sprawling nature of modern regulation  commercial law spans general corporate law  employment and labor law  health care law  securities law  m a law  who specialize in acquisitions   tax law  erisa law  erisa in the united states governs employee benefit plans   food and drug regulatory law  intellectual property law  specializing in copyrights  patents  trademarks and such   telecommunications law  and more    intellectual property   businesses often have important    intellectual property    that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable  this could require patents  copyrights  trademarks or preservation of trade secrets  most businesses have names  logos and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking  patents and copyrights in the united states are largely governed by federal law  while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law  because of the nature of intellectual property  a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors  many countries are signatories to international   treaty treaties   concerning intellectual property  and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties  in order to protect trade secrets  companies may require employees to sign non compete clauses which will impose limitations on an employees interactions with stakeholders  and competitors   see also    portal business and economics         accounting       list of accounting topics

 trade name      from   greek language greek     politikos    of  for  or relating to citizens   is the   art   or   science   of influencing people on a civic  or individual level  when there are more than 2 people involved modern political discourse focuses on democracy and the relationship between people and politics   it is thought of as the way we  choose government officials and make decisions about public policy     etymology     the word   politics   comes from the   greek language greek   word   politics  aristotle                politika     modeled on   aristotle   s  affairs of the city   the name of his book on governing and governments  which was rendered in english in the mid 15th century as latinized  polettiques    thus it became  politics  in   middle english   c  1520s  see the   concise oxford dictionary     the singular   politic   first attested in english 1430 and comes from   middle french     politique    in turn from   latin     politicus     which is the   latinisation  literature  latinisation   of the greek              politikos     meaning amongst others  of  for  or relating to citizens    civil    civic    belonging to the state    in turn from            polites      citizen   and that from            polis        city      history   the history of politics is reflected in the origin and development  and economics of the institutions of   government       the state       the origin of the   state  polity  state   is to be found in the development of the   art of warfare art of warfare    historically speaking  all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare   kings  emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including china and japan  were considered divine  of the institutions that ruled states  that of   kingship   stood at the forefront until the french revolution put an end to the    divine right of kings      nevertheless  the monarchy is among the longest lasting political institutions  dating as early as 2100 bc in sumeria   to the 21st century ad british monarchy   kingship becomes an institution through heredity the king often  even in   monarchy absolute monarchies    ruled his kingdom with the aid of an elite group of advisors  a   privy council council   without which he could not maintain power  as these advisors  and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power    constitutional monarchy constitutional monarchies   emerged  which may be considered the germ of   constitutional government   long before the council became a bulwark of democracy  it rendered invaluable aid to the institution of kingship by  preserving the institution of kingship through heredity   preserving the traditions of the social order   being able to withstand criticism as an impersonal authority   being able to manage a greater deal of knowledge and action than a single individual such as the king the greatest of the king s subordinates  the   earls      archduke  s and   dukes   in england and scotland  the   dukes   and   counts   in the continent  always sat as a right on the council  a conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts   tribute    one of the functions of the council is to keep the coffers of the king full  another is the satisfaction of   military service   and the establishment of   lordship  s by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers       the state and property       property   is the right vested on the individual or a group of people to enjoy the benefits of an object be it material or intellectual  a right is a power enforced by public trust  sometimes it happens that the exercise of a right is opposed to public trust  nevertheless  a right is really an institution brought around by public trust  past  present or future  the growth of knowledge is the key to the history of property as an institution  the more man becomes knowledgeable of an object be it physical or intellectual  the more it is appropriated  the appearance of the state brought about the final stage in the evolution of property from wildlife to husbandry  in the presence of the state  man can hold landed property  the state began granting lordships and ended up conferring property and with it came   inheritance    with landed property came rent and in the exchange of goods  profit  so that in modern times  the  lord of the land  of long ago becomes the landlord  if it is wrongly assumed that the value of land is always the same  then there is of course no evolution of property whatever  however  the price of land goes up with every increase in population benefitting the landlord  the landlordism of large land owners has been the most rewarded of all political services  in industry  the position of the landlord is less important but in towns which have grown out of an industry  the fortunate landlord has reaped an enormous profit  towards the latter part of the middle ages in europe  both the state   the state would use the instrument of   confiscation   for the first time to satisfy a debt   and the church   the church succeeded in acquiring immense quantities of land   were allied against the village community to displace the small landlord and they were successful to the extent that today  the village has become the ideal of the   individualist    a place in which every man  does what he wills with his own   the state has been the most important factor in the evolution of the institution of property be it public or private       the state and the justice system     as a primarily military institution  the state is concerned with the   allegiance   of its subjects viewing disloyalty and   espionage   as well as other sorts of   conspiracy  political  conspiracies   as detrimental to its national security  thus arises the law of   treason    criminal acts in general  breaking the peace and treason make up the whole  or at least part of   criminal law   enforced by the state as distinguished from   private law the law enforced by private individuals or by the state on behalf of private individuals    state justice has taken the place of clan  feudal  merchant and ecclesiastical justice due to its strength  skill and simplicity  one very striking evidence of the superiority of the royal courts over the feudal and popular courts in the matter of official skill is the fact that  until comparatively late in history  the royal courts alone kept written records of their proceedings  the   trial by jury   was adopted by the royal courts  securing it s popularity and making it a bulwark of liberty  by the time of the   protestant reformation    with the separation of church and state  in the most progressive countries  the state succeeded in dealing with the business of administering justice       the state     the making of laws was unknown to primitive societies that most persistent of all patriarchal societies  the   jewish    retains to a certain extent its tribal law in the   gentile   cities of the west  this tribal law is the rudimentary idea of law as it presented itself to people in the patriarchal stage of society  it was   convention  norm  custom   or   observance   sanctioned by the approval and practice of ancestorsthe state of affairs which existed in the 10th century  when every town had its own laws and nations like france  germany  spain and other countries had no national law until the end of the 18th century  was brought to an end  by three great agencies that helped to create the modern system of law and legislation     records     from the early middle ages in europe there come what are called folk laws and they appear exactly at the time when the patriarchal is becoming the state  they are due almost universally to one cause  the desire of the king to know the custom of his subjects  these are not legislation in the sense of law making but statements or declarations of custom  they are drawn from a knowledge of the custom of the people  unwritten custom changes imperceptibly but not the written  it is always possible to point to the exact text and show what it says  nevertheless  the written text can change by addition with every new edition      law courts     by taking some general rule which seemed to be common to all the communities and ignoring the differences  english common law was modeled after such a practice so that the law became common in all the districts of the kingdom  the reason why in the rest of europe  there was no common law till centuries later is because the state in those countries did not get hold of the administration of justice when england did  one of the shrewdest moves by which the english judges pushed their plan of making a common law was by limiting the verdict of the jury in every case to   questions of fact    at first the jury used to give answers both on law and fact  and being a purely local body  they followed local custom  a famous division came to pass  the province of the judge and the province of the jury      fictions     records and law courts were valuable in helping the people adapt to law making but like fictions  they were slow and imperfect  though slowly  fictions work because it is a well known fact that people will accept a change in the form of a fiction while they would resist it to the end if the fact is out in the open    finally there is the enactment of laws or legislation  when progress and development is rapid  the faster method of   political representation   is adopted  this method does not originate in primitive society but in the state need for money and its use of an assembly to raise the same  from the town assembly  a national assembly and the progress of commerce sprang   parliament   all over europe around the end of the 12th century but not entirely representative or homogeneous for the nobility and the clergy  the clergy had amassed a fortune in land  about one fifth of all christendom but at the time  in the 12th and 13th centuries  the church was following a policy of isolation  they adopted the rule of   celibacy   and cut themselves from domestic life  they refused to plead in a secular court  they refused to pay taxes to the state on the grounds that they had already paid it to the   pope    since the main object of the king in holding a national assembly was to collect money  the church could not be left out and so they came to parliament  the church did not like it but in most cases they had to comethe medieval parliament was complete when it represented all the states in the realm  nobles  clergy  peasants and craftsmen but it was not a popular institution mainly because it meant   taxation    only by the strongest pressure of the crown were parliaments maintained during the first century of their existence and the best proof of this assertion lies in the fact that in those countries where the crown was weak  parliament ceased to exist  the notion that parliaments were the result of a democratic movement cannot be supported by historical facts  originally  the representative side of parliament was solely concerned with money  representation in parliament was a liability rather than a privilege  it is not uncommon that an institution created for one purpose begins to serve another  people who were asked to contribute with large sums of money began to   petition    pretty soon  sessions in parliament would turn into bargaining tables  the king granting petitions in exchange for money  however  there were two kinds of petitions  one private and the other public and it was from this last that laws were adopted or   legislation   originated  the king as head of state could give orders to preserve territorial integrity but not until these royal enactments were combined with public petition that successful legislation ever took place  even to the present day  this has always been the basis of all successful legislation  public custom is adopted and enforced by the statein the early days of political representation  the   majority   did not necessarily carry the day and there was very little need for contested   election  s but by the beginning of the 15th century  a seat in parliament was something to be cherished  historically speaking  the dogma of the equality of man is the result of the adoption of the purely practical machinery of the majority but the adoption of the majority principle is also responsible for another institution of modern times  the   party system    the party system is an elaborate piece of machinery that pits at least two political candidates against each other for the vote of an electorate  its advantage being equal representation interesting a large number of people in politics  it provides effective criticism of the government in power and it affords an outlet for the ambition of a large number of wealthy and educated people guaranteeing a consistent policy in governmentthese three institutions  political representation  majority rule and the party system are the basic components of modern political machinery  they are applicable to both central and local governments and are becoming by their adaptability ends in themselves rather than a machinery to achieve some purpose       the state and the executive system     the administration is one of the most difficult aspects of government  in the enactment and enforcement of laws  the victory of the state is complete but not so in regards to administration the reason being that it is easy to see the advantage of the enactment and enforcement of laws but not the administration of domestic  religious and business affairs which should be kept to a minimum by government   bundeskanzleramt  in   berlin    originally  the state was a military institution  for many years  it was just a territory ruled by a king who was surrounded by a small elite group of warriors and court officials and it was basically rule by force over a larger mass of people  slowly  however  the people gained political representation for none can really be said to be a member of the state without the right of having a voice in the direction of policy making  one of the basic functions of the state in regards to administration is maintaining peace and internal order  it has no other excuse for interfering in the lives of its citizens  to maintain law and order the state develops means of   communication    historically  the  king s highway  was laid down and maintained for the convenience of the royal armies not as an incentive to   commerce    in almost all countries  the state maintains the control of the means of communication and special freedoms such as those delineated in the   first amendment to the united states constitution   are rather limited  the state s original function of maintaining law and order within its borders gave rise to   police   administration which is a branch of the dispensation of   justice   but on its preventive side  police jurisdiction has a special character of its own  which distinguishes it from ordinary judicial work  in the   curfew    the state shows early in history the importance of preventing disorder  in early days  next to maintaining law and order  the state was concerned with the raising of   revenue     it was then useful to the state to establish a   technical standard standard   of   weights and measures   so that value could be generally accepted and finally the state acquired a   monopoly   of   coin  age  the regulation of labor by the state as one of its functions dates from the 15th century  when   the black plague   killed around half of the european populationthe invariable policy of the state has always been to break down all intermediate authorities and to deal directly with the individual  this was the policy until   adam smith   s     the wealth of nations     was published promoting a strong public reaction against state interference  by its own action  the state raised the issue of the poor or the state relief of the   indigent    the state  of course  did not create poverty but by destroying the chief agencies which dealt with it such as the village  the church and the   guild  s  it practically assumed full responsibility for the poor without exercising any power over it  the great poor law report of 1834 showed that   communism   was widespread in the rural areas of england  in newly developed countries such as the   colonies   of the   british empire    the state has refused to take responsibility for the poor and the relief of poverty  although the poor classes lean heavily towards state socialismtaking into account the arguably significant powers of the state  it is only natural that in times of great crisis such as an overwhelming calamity the people should invoke general state aidpolitical representation has helped to shape state administration  when the voice of the individual can be heard  the danger of arbitrary interference by the state is greatly reduced  to that extent is the increase of state activity popular  there are no hard and fast rules to limit state administration but it is a fallacy to believe that the state is the nation and what the state does is necessarily for the good of the nation  in the first place  even in modern times  the state and the nation are never identical  even where  universal suffrage  prevails  the fact remains that an extension of state administration means an increased interference of some by others  limiting freedom of action  even if it is admitted that state and nation are one and the same  it is sometimes difficult to admit that state administration is necessarily good  finally  the modern indiscriminate advocacy of state administration conceals the fallacy that state officials must necessarily prove more effective in their action than   private enterprise    herein lies the basic difference between   public administration public   and   business administration    the first deals with the   public weal   while the second deals basically in   profit  accounting  profit   but both require a great deal of   education   and   ethical code ethical conduct   to avoid the mishaps inherent in the relationship not only relating to   corporate law business   and   labour rights labour   but also the state and the people administrating its   government         the varieties of political experience          according to aristotle  states are classified into   monarchies      aristocracy aristocracies      timocracy timocracies      democracies      oligarchies    and   tyrannies    due to an increase in knowledge of the history of politics  this classification has been abandoned  generally speaking  no form of government could be considered the absolute best  as it would have to be the perfect form under all circumstances  for all people and in all ways  as an institution created by the human nature to   governance govern society    it is vulnerable to   political corruption abuse by people for their own gain    no matter what form of government a state utillises  thus posing that there is no  best  form of government all states are varieties of a single type  the sovereign state  all the   great powers   of the modern world rule on the principle of   sovereignty    sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an   autocracy autocratic government   or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government    constitutions   are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government  although a constitution is a written document  there is also an unwritten constitution  the unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative branch of government  this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate  nevertheless  the written constitution is essential  england did set the fashion of written constitutions during the   english civil war civil war   but after the   restoration  england  restoration   abandoned them to be taken up later by the   american colonies   after their   emancipation   and then   france   after the   french revolution revolution   and the rest of europe including the european coloniesthere are two forms of government  one a strong central government as in france and the other a local government such as the ancient divisions in england that is comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic  these two forms helped to shape the   federal government    first in switzerland  then in the united states in 1776  in canada in 1867 and in germany in 1870 and in the 20th century    australia    the federal states introduced the new principle of agreement or   contract    compared to a   federation    a   confederation   s singular weakness is that it lacks   judicial power   in the   american civil war    the contention of the confederate states that a state could   secede   from the union was untenable because of the power enjoyed by the federal government in the executive  legislative and judiciary branchesaccording to professor   a  v  dicey   in   an introduction to the study of the law of the constitution    the essential features of a federal constitution are  a  a written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the federal and state authorities  b  a distribution of power between the federal and state governments and c  a supreme court vested with the power to interpret the constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches     political party   a    political party    is a   political organization   that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within   government    usually by participating in   elections electoral campaigns    educational outreach or protest actions  parties often espouse an expressed   ideology   or vision bolstered by a written   party platform platform   with specific goals  forming a   coalition   among disparate interests   world politics     building in   new york city    the 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the   third reich   but also the rise and fall of   communism    the development of the   atomic bomb   gave the united states a more rapid end to its conflict in japan in   world war ii    later  the development of the   hydrogen bomb   became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction  the   united nations   has served as a forum for peace in a world threatened by nuclear war   the invention of nuclear and space weapons has made war unacceptable as an instrument for achieving political ends    although an all out final nuclear holocaust is out of the question for man     nuclear blackmail    comes into question not only on the issue of world peace but also on the issue of national sovereignty   on a sunday in 1962  the world stood still at the brink of nuclear war during the october   cuban missile crisis   from the implementation of   u s    vs   u s s r    nuclear blackmail policy   as an academic discipline    political science    the study of politics  examines the acquisition and application of   political power power     political scientist   harold lasswell   defined politics as  who gets what  when  and how    related areas of study include   political philosophy    which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour    political economy    which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two  and   public administration    which examines the practices of governance the philosopher   charles blattberg    who has defined politics as  responding to conflict with dialogue   offers an account which distinguishes political philosophies from political ideologies  the first academic chair devoted to politics in the united states was the chair of history and political science at   columbia university    first occupied by prussian  migr    francis lieber   in 1857    spectra      several different   political spectrum  s have been proposed    left right politics   recently in history  political analysts and politicians divide politics into   left wing   and   right wing   politics  often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left  this classification is comparatively recent  it was not used by   aristotle   or   hobbes    for instance   and dates from the   french revolution   era  when those members of the   national assembly   who supported the   republic    the common people and a   secular society   sat on the left and supporters of the   monarchy      aristocracy  class  aristocratic   privilege and the church sat on the right  the meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years  a particularly influential event was the publication of the   communist manifesto   by   karl marx   and   frederick engels   in 1848  the   manifesto   suggested a course of action for a   proletarian   revolution to overthrow the   bourgeoisie bourgeois   society and abolish private property  in the belief that this would lead to a   classless   and   stateless communism stateless   societythe meaning of left wing and right wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times  but generally speaking  it can be said that the right wing often values   tradition   and   social stratification   while the left wing often values   reform   and   egalitarianism    with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with   social democracy   or   regulated market regulated capitalism    according to   norberto bobbio    one of the major exponents of this distinction  the left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality  while the right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities  and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian  some ideologies  notably   christian democracy    claim to combine left and right wing politics  according to geoffrey k  roberts and patricia hogwood   in terms of ideology  christian democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals  conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and christian principles    movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left right divide include   fascist     terza posizione   economic politics in italy    gaullism   in france    peronism   in argentina  and   national action party  mexico   national action  politics national action politics   in mexico   authoritarian libertarian politics     authoritarianism   and   civil libertarianism libertarianism   refer to the amount of individual   freedom  political  freedom   each person possesses in that society relative to the state  one author describes authoritarian political systems as those where  individual   rights   and goals are subjugated to group goals  expectations and conformities    while libertarians generally oppose the   sovereign state state   and hold the   individual   as   sovereign    in their purest form  libertarians are   anarchism anarchists    who argue for the total abolition of the state  of   political parties   and of   political organisation other political entities    while the purest authoritarians are  theoretically    totalitarianism totalitarians   who support state control over all aspects of   society  for instance    classical liberalism    also known as     laissez faire   liberalism     or  in much of the world  simply   liberalism    is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and   limited government    this includes the importance of human rationality  individual   property rights      free market  s    natural rights    the protection of   civil liberties    constitutional limitation of government  and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of   john locke      adam smith      david hume      david ricardo      voltaire      montesquieu   and others  according to the libertarian   institute for humane studies     the libertarian  or  classical liberal   perspective is that individual well being  prosperity  and social harmony are fostered by  as much liberty as possible  and  as little government as necessary     for anarchist political philosopher   l  susan brown    liberalism and   anarchism   are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual   freedom of will freedom   yet differ from one another in very distinct ways  anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism s competitive property relations     political corruption     political corruption    is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain  misuse of government power for other purposes  such as   political repression repression   of political opponents and general police brutality  is not considered political corruption  neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government  an illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official dutiesforms of corruption vary  but include   bribery      extortion      cronyism      nepotism      patronage      political corruption graft graft    and   embezzlement    while corruption may facilitate   organized crime criminal enterprise   such as   drug trafficking      money laundering    and   human trafficking trafficking    it is not restricted to these activities  the activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or jurisdiction  for instance  certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another  in some cases  government officials have broad or poorly defined powers  which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actionsworldwide  bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion us dollars annually   a state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a   kleptocracy    literally meaning  rule by thieves   see also    sister project links politics      index of

branches fields of engineering    each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of technology and types of application the   american engineers  council for professional development    ecpd  the predecessor of   accreditation board for engineering and technology abet     has defined  engineering  as  blockquote the creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures  machines  apparatus  or manufacturing processes  or works utilizing them singly or in combination  or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design  or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions  all as respects an intended function  economics of operation or safety to life and property     blockquote one who practices engineering is called an   engineer    and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as   professional engineer      chartered engineer      incorporated engineer      ingenieur   or   european engineer      history   engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the pulley  lever  and wheel  each of these inventions is consistent with the modern definition of engineering  exploiting basic mechanical principles to develop useful tools and objects the term   engineering   itself has a much more recent etymology  deriving from the word   engineer    which itself dates back to 1325  when an   engine er    literally  one who operates an   engine    originally referred to  a constructor of military engines    in this context  now obsolete  an  engine  referred to a military machine    i e     a mechanical contraption used in war  for example  a   catapult     notable exceptions of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps    e g     the   united states army corps of engineers u s  army corps of engineers   the word  engine  itself is of even older origin  ultimately deriving from the   latin     ingenium    c  1250   meaning  innate quality  especially mental power  hence a clever invention   later  as the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline  the term   civil engineering    he may also have been responsible for the first known use of   column  s in   architecture    ancient greece   developed machines in both the civilian and military domains  the   antikythera mechanism    the first known   analog computer mechanical computer      and the mechanical   archimedes discoveries and inventions inventions   of   archimedes   are examples of early mechanical engineering  some of archimedes  inventions as well as the antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of   differential  mechanical device  differential gearing   or   epicyclic gearing    two key principles in machine theory that helped design the   gear train  s of the industrial revolution  and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as   robotics   and   automotive engineering    chinese  greek and roman armies employed complex military machines and inventions such as   artillery   which was developed by the greeks around the 4th century b c    the   trireme    the   ballista   and the   catapult    in the middle ages  the   trebuchet   was developed    renaissance era   the first   electrical engineer   is considered to be   william gilbert  astronomer  william gilbert    with his 1600 publication of   de magnete    who coined the term    electricity     the first   steam engine   was built in 1698 by   mechanical engineer     thomas savery     the development of this device gave rise to the   industrial revolution   in the coming decades  allowing for the beginnings of   mass production   with the rise of engineering as a   profession   in the 18th century  the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends  similarly  in addition to military and civil engineering the fields then known as the   mechanic arts   became incorporated into engineering    modern era     represents a modern engineering challenge from many disciplines     electrical engineering   can trace its origins back to the experiments of   alessandro volta   in the 1800s  the experiments of   michael faraday      georg ohm   and others and the invention of the   electric motor   in 1872  the work of   james clerk maxwell james maxwell   and   heinrich hertz   in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of   electronics    the later inventions of the   vacuum tube   and the   transistor   further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty   its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of   sir george cayley   has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century  early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering  the first   doctor of philosophy phd   in engineering  technically    applied science and engineering    awarded in the united states went to   willard gibbs   at   yale university   in 1863  it was also the second phd awarded in science in the u s  only a decade after the successful flights by the   wright brothers    there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in   world war i     meanwhile  research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining   theoretical physics   with experiments in 1990  with the rise of   computer   technology  the first   search engine  computing  search engine   was built by   computer engineer     alan emtage      main branches of engineering      engineering  much like other science  is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several sub disciplines  these disciplines concern themselves with differing areas of engineering work  although initially an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline  throughout an engineer s career the engineer may become multi disciplined  having worked in several of the outlined areas  engineering is often characterized as having four main branches        chemical engineering     the application of physics  chemistry  biology  and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale     civil engineering     the design and construction of public and private works  such as   infrastructure      airports      roads      railways    water supply and treatment etc      bridge  s  dams  and buildings     electrical engineering     the design and study of various electrical and electronic systems  such as   electrical circuit  s    electrical generator generators      electric motor motors      electromagnetism electromagnetic     electromechanical   devices    electronic devices      electronic circuits      optical fiber  s    optoelectronic device  s    computer   systems    telecommunications    instrumentation  controls  and   electronics       mechanical engineering     the design of physical or mechanical systems  such as power and   energy   systems    aerospace     aircraft   products    weapon systems      transportation   products   internal combustion engine engine  s    gas compressor compressors      powertrain  s    kinematic chain  s  vacuum technology  and   vibration isolation   equipment beyond these four  sources vary on other main branches   historically    naval architecture naval engineering   and   mining engineering   were major branches   modern fields sometimes included as major branches include   aerospace engineering aerospace      computer engineering computer      electronic engineering electronic      petroleum engineering petroleum      systems engineering systems      audio engineering audio      software engineering software      architectural engineering architectural      biosystems engineering biosystems      biomedical engineering biomedical       industrial engineering industrial      materials science materials     and   nuclear engineering nuclear    engineering  new specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches   for example   earth systems engineering and management   involves a wide range of subject areas including   anthropology    engineering    environmental science      ethics   and   philosophy    a new or emerging area of application will commonly be defined temporarily as a permutation or subset of existing disciplines  there is often gray area as to when a given sub field becomes large and or prominent enough to warrant classification as a new  branch   one key indicator of such emergence is when major universities start establishing departments and programs in the new field for each of these fields there exists considerable overlap  especially in the areas of the application of sciences to their disciplines such as physics  chemistry and mathematics    methodology     requires collaboration of engineers from many fields  as the system involves mechanical  electro magnetic and chemical processes  the   turbine blade blades      stator rotor and stator   as well as the   steam cycle   all need to be carefully designed and optimized   engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find suitable solutions to problems or to make improvements to the status quo  more than ever  engineers are now required to have knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects  as a result  they may keep on learning new material throughout their career if multiple options exist  engineers weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements  the crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify  understand  and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result  it is usually not enough to build a technically successful product  it must also meet further requirements constraints may include available resources  physical  imaginative or technical limitations  flexibility for future modifications and additions  and other factors  such as requirements for cost    safety engineering safety    marketability  productibility  and   serviceability  computer  serviceability    by understanding the constraints  engineers derive   specifications   for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated     problem solving    engineers use  their knowledge of   science      mathematics      logic      economics    and   empirical knowledge appropriate experience   or   tacit knowledge   to find suitable solutions to a problem   creating an appropriate   mathematical model   of a problem allows them to analyze it  sometimes definitively   and to test potential solutions usually multiple reasonable solutions exist  so engineers must evaluate the different   design choice  s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements     genrich altshuller    after gathering statistics on a large number of   patent  s  suggested that   compromise  s are at the heart of    level of invention low level    engineering designs  while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full scale production  they use  among other things    prototype  s    scale model  s    simulation  s    destructive testing destructive test  s    nondestructive testing nondestructive tests    and   stress testing stress tests    testing ensures that products will perform as expected engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large  engineers typically include a   factor of safety   in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure  however  the greater the safety factor  the less efficient the design may be the study of failed products is known as   forensic engineering    and can help the   product design  er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions  the discipline is of greatest value after disasters  such as   bridge collapse  s  when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure    computer use     during re entry  solutions to the flow require   finite element method modelling   of the combined effects of the   navier stokes equation fluid flow   and   heat equation heat   equations   as with all modern scientific and technological endeavors  computers and software play an increasingly important role  as well as the typical business   application software   there are a number of computer aided applications    cax computer aided technologies    specifically for engineering  computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes  which can be solved using   numerical method  s one of the most widely used tools in the profession is   computer aided design    cad  software like   autodesk inventor      dss solidworks    or   pro engineer   which enables engineers to create 3d models  2d drawings  and schematics of their designs  cad together with   digital mockup    dmu  and   computer aided engineering cae   software such as   finite element method finite element method analysis   or   analytic element method   allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time consuming physical prototypes these allow products and components to be checked for flaws  assess fit and assembly  study ergonomics  and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses  temperatures  electromagnetic emissions  electrical currents and voltages  digital logic levels  fluid flows  and kinematics  access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of   product data management   software  there are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as   computer aided manufacture    cam  software to generate   cnc   machining instructions    manufacturing process management   software for production engineering    electronic design automation eda   for   printed circuit board    pcb  and circuit   schematic  s for electronic engineers    maintenance  repair and operations mro   applications for maintenance management  and   architecture  engineering and construction aec   software for civil engineering in recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as   product lifecycle management    plm     social context  engineering is a subject that ranges from large collaborations to small individual projects   almost all engineering projects are beholden to some sort of financing agency  a company  a set of investors  or a government  the few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are   pro bono   engineering and   open design   engineering by its very nature engineering is bound up with society and human behavior  every product or construction used by modern society will have been influenced by engineering design  engineering design is a very powerful tool to make changes to environment  society and economies  and its application brings with it a great responsibility   many   engineering society engineering societies   have established codes of practice and   engineering ethics codes of ethics   to guide members and inform the public at large engineering projects can be subject to controversy  examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of   nuclear weapon  s  the   three gorges dam    the design and use of   sport utility vehicle  s and the extraction of   fuel oil oil    in response  some western engineering companies have enacted serious   corporate social responsibility corporate and social responsibility   policies engineering is a key driver of human development   sub saharan africa in particular has a very small engineering capacity which results in many african nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid the attainment of many of the   millennium development goals   requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development  all overseas development and relief ngos make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios  a number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind    engineers without borders     engineers against poverty   registered engineers for disaster relief   engineers for a sustainable world     engineering for change   engineering ministries international    relationships with other disciplines       science      there exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice  in engineering  one applies science  both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of   materials   and phenomena   both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks  such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes  conversely  in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena  thus becoming  for the moment  scientists  in the book     what engineers know and how they know it       walter vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research  first  it often deals with areas in which the basic   physics   and or   chemistry   are well understood  but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner examples are the use of numerical approximations to the   navier stokes equations   to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft  or the use of   metal fatigue miner s rule   to calculate fatigue damage  second  engineering research employs many semi   empirical methods   that are foreign to pure scientific research  one example being the method of parameter variationas stated by fung et al  in the revision to the classic engineering text  foundations of   solid mechanics    blockquote  engineering is quite different from science  scientists try to understandnature  engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature  engineersstress invention  to embody an invention the engineer must put his idea inconcrete terms  and design something that people can use  that somethingcan be a device  a gadget  a material  a method  a computing program  aninnovative experiment  a new solution to a problem  or an improvement onwhat is existing  since a design has to be concrete  it must have its geometry dimensions  and characteristic numbers  almost all engineers workingon new designs find that they do not have all the needed information  mostoften  they are limited by insufficient scientific knowledge  thus they studymathematics  physics  chemistry  biology and mechanics  often they haveto add to the sciences relevant to their profession  thus engineering sciencesare born     blockquote although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles  engineers must also take into account safety  efficiency  economy  reliability and constructability or ease of fabrication  as well as legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution     medicine and biology       seen here in a self portrait  has been described as the epitome of the artist engineer    the fields of   bionics   and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems conversely  some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying  and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing   biology   with technology  this has led to fields such as   artificial intelligence      neural networks      fuzzy logic    and   robot  ics   there are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine   both fields provide solutions to real world problems  this often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and   empirical   knowledge is an integral part of both medicine  in part  studies the function of the human body  the human body  as a biological machine  has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods  the heart for example functions much like a pump   the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers   the brain produces   signal  electrical engineering  electrical signal  s etc   these similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine  led to the development of the field of   biomedical engineering   that uses concepts developed in both disciplines newly emerging branches of science  such as   systems biology    are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering  such as systems modeling and computational analysis  to the description of biological systems  they are direct in some fields  for example    architecture      landscape architecture   and   industrial design    even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university s   faculty  division  faculty   of engineering   and indirect in others    the   art institute of chicago

south florida    an engineering professor  through a grant with the   national science foundation    has developed a course that connects art and engineering  among famous historical figures

science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology  biologie  or the doctrine of life  lebenslehre    1 4 although modern biology is a relatively recent development  sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times    natural philosophy   was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of   mesopotamia      egypt    the   indian subcontinent    and   china    however  the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to   ancient greece     while the formal study of   medicine   dates back to   hippocrates    ca  460 bc   ca  370 bc   it was   aristotle    384 bc   322 bc  who contributed most extensively to the development of biology  especially important are his   history of animals   and other works where he showed naturalist leanings  and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life  aristotle s successor at the   lyceum      theophrastus    wrote a series of books on   botany   that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences  even into the   middle ages   scholars of the medieval islamic world who wrote on biology included   al jahiz    781 869     al dinawari    828 896   who wrote on botany   and   muhammad ibn zakar ya r zi rhazes    865 925  who wrote on   anatomy   and   physiology    medicine was especially well studied by islamic scholars working in greek philosopher traditions  while natural history drew heavily on aristotelian thought  especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life biology began to quickly develop and grow with   antony van leeuwenhoek   s improvement of the   microscope    it was then that scholars discovered   spermatozoa      bacteria      infusoria   and the diversity of microscopic life  investigations by   jan swammerdam   led to new interest in   entomology   and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic   dissection   and   staining    advances in   microscopy   also had a profound impact on biological thinking  in the early 19th century  a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the   cell  biology  cell    then  in 1838    matthias jakob schleiden schleiden   and   theodor schwann schwann   began promoting the now universal ideas that  1  the basic unit of organisms is the cell and  2  that individual cells have all the characteristics of   life    although they opposed the idea that  3  all cells come from the division of other cells  thanks to the work of   robert remak   and   rudolf virchow    however  by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as   cell theory    meanwhile  taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians    carl linnaeus   published a basic   taxonomy   for the natural world in 1735  variations of which have been in use ever since   and in the 1750s introduced   binomial nomenclature scientific names   for all his species     georges louis leclerc  comte de buffon    treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable even suggesting the possibility of   common descent    though he was opposed to evolution  buffon is a key figure in the   history of evolutionary thought    his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both   lamarck   and   charles darwin darwin    serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of   jean baptiste lamarck    who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution   he posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals  meaning that the more frequently and rigorously an organ was used  the more complex and efficient it would become  thus adapting the animal to its environment  lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal s offspring  who would further develop and perfect them   however  it was the british naturalist   charles darwin    combining the biogeographical approach of humboldt  the uniformitarian geology of lyell    thomas malthus malthus s   writings on population growth  and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations  who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on   natural selection    similar reasoning and evidence led   alfred russel wallace   to independently reach the same conclusions   although it was the subject of   creation evolution controversy controversy    which continues to this day   darwin s theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology the discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and   population genetics    in the 1940s and early 1950s  experiments pointed to   dna   as the component of   chromosomes   that held the trait carrying units that had become known as   genes    a focus on new kinds of model organisms such as   viruses   and   bacteria    along with the discovery of the double helical structure of dna in 1953  marked the transition to the era of   molecular genetics    from the 1950s to present times  biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain  the   genetic code   was cracked by   har gobind khorana      robert w  holley   and   marshall warren nirenberg   after dna was understood to contain   codons    finally  the   human genome project   was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human   genome    this project was essentially completed in 2003   with further analysis still being published  the human genome project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional  molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms   foundations of modern biology  much of modern biology can be encompassed within five unifying principles  cell theory  evolution  genetics  homeostasis  and energy   additionally  the phenomenon of   energy transfer energy flow   occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as   metabolism    finally  cells contain hereditary information    dna    which is passed from cell to cell during cell division    evolution     of a population for dark coloration   a central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through   evolution    and that all life forms known have a   common descent common origin    introduced into the scientific lexicon by   jean baptiste de lamarck   in 1809   evolution was established by   charles darwin   fifty years later as a viable scientific model when he articulated its driving force    natural selection         alfred russel wallace   is recognized as the co discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution    evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on earth darwin theorized that species and breeds developed through the processes of   natural selection   and   artificial selection   or   selective breeding       genetic drift   was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the   modern synthesis   of the theory  the evolutionary history of the   species   which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its   phylogeny    widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny  these include the comparisons of   dna sequence  s conducted within   molecular biology   or   genomics    and comparisons of   fossil  s or other records of ancient organisms in   paleontology     biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods  including   phylogenetics      phenetics    and   cladistics     for a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists  see   evolutionary timeline    the theory of evolution postulates that all   organism  s on the   earth    both living and extinct  have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral   gene pool    this last universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about   timeline of evolution 3 5 billion years ago     biologists generally regard the universality and ubiquity of the   genetic code   as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all   bacterium bacteria      archaea    and   eukaryote  s  see    origin of life       depicting a cross between two pea plants heterozygous for purple  b  and white  b  blossoms     genetics     gene  s are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms  a   gene   is a unit of   heredity   and corresponds to a region of   dna   that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways  all organisms  from bacteria to animals  share the same basic machinery that copies and translates dna into   protein  s  cells   transcription  genetics  transcribe   a dna gene into an   rna   version of the gene  and a   ribosome   then   translation  biology  translates   the rna into a protein  a sequence of   amino acid  s  the   genetic code translation code   from rna codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms  but slightly different for some  for example  a sequence of dna that codes for   insulin   in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms  such as plants  dna usually occurs as linear   chromosome  s in   eukaryote  s  and circular chromosomes in   prokaryote  s  a chromosome is an organized structure consisting of   dna   and   histone  s  the set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the   mitochondria      chloroplasts    or other locations is collectively known as its   genome    in eukaryotes  genomic dna is located in the   cell nucleus    along with small amounts in   mitochondrion mitochondria   and   chloroplast  s  in prokaryotes  the dna is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the   nucleoid     the genetic information in a genome is held within genes  and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its   genotype       homeostasis     secretes   corticotropin releasing hormone crh    which directs the   pituitary gland   to secrete   acth    in turn  acth directs the adrenal cortex to secrete   glucocorticoid  s  such as   cortisol    the gcs then reduce the rate of secretion by the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland once a sufficient amount of gcs has been released      homeostasis   is the ability of an   open system  systems theory  open system   to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple   dynamic equilibrium   adjustments controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms  all living   organism  s  whether   single celled unicellular   or   multicellular    exhibit homeostasis  to maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions  a system must detect and respond to perturbations  after the detection of a perturbation  a biological system normally responds through   negative feedback    this means stabilizing conditions by either reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system  one example is the release of   glucagon   when sugar levels are too low        energy   the survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of   energy    chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract   chemistry energy energy   from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them  in this process    molecule  s of   chemical substance  s that constitute   food   play two roles  first  they contain energy that can be transformed for biological   chemical reaction  s  second  they develop new molecular structures made up of biomolecules the organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or   autotroph  s  nearly all of these organisms originally draw energy from the sun   plants and other   phototroph  s use solar energy via a process known as   photosynthesis   to convert raw materials into organic molecules  such as   adenosine triphosphate atp    whose bonds can be broken to release energy   a few   ecosystems    however  depend entirely on energy extracted by   chemotroph  s from   methane      sulfides    or other non   solar energy luminal   energy sources  some of the captured energy is used to produce   biomass   to sustain   life   and provide energy for growth and development  the majority of the rest of this energy is lost as heat and waste molecules  the most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are   metabolism    and   cellular respiration      research     structural     depicting the various   organelle  s and structures     molecular biology   is the study of biology at a molecular level   this field overlaps with other areas of biology  particularly with   genetics   and   biochemistry    molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell  including the interrelationship of dna  rna  and protein synthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated   cell biology   studies the structural and   physiology physiological   properties of   cell  biology  cells    including their   behavior  s  interactions  and   natural environment environment    this is done on both the   microscope microscopic   and   molecule molecular   levels  for single celled organisms such as   bacterium bacteria   as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as   human  s  understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences  the similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology   anatomy   considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as   organ  biology  organs   and organ systems    genetics   is the science of   gene  s    heredity    and the variation of   organism  s    genes encode the information necessary for synthesizing proteins  which in turn play a large role in influencing  though  in many instances  not completely determining  the final   phenotype   of the organism  in modern research  genetics provides important tools in the investigation of the function of a particular gene  or the analysis of   genetic interaction  s  within organisms  genetic information generally is carried in   chromosome  s  where it is represented in the   dna sequence chemical structure   of particular   dna     molecule  s   developmental biology   studies the process by which organisms grow and develop  originating in   embryology    modern developmental biology studies the genetic control of   cell growth      cellular differentiation differentiation    and    morphogenesis     which is the process that progressively gives rise to   biological tissue tissues      organ  anatomy  organs    and   anatomy     model organism  s for developmental biology include the round worm     caenorhabditis elegans       the fruit fly     drosophila melanogaster       the zebrafish     danio rerio       the mouse     mus musculus        and the weed     arabidopsis thaliana         a model organism is a   species   that is extensively studied to understand particular biological   phenomena    with the expectation that discoveries made in that organism provide insight into the workings of other organisms      physiological   physiology studies the mechanical  physical  and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole  the theme of  structure to function  is central to biology  physiological studies have traditionally been divided into   plant physiology   and   animal physiology    but some principles of physiology are universal  no matter what particular   organism   is being studied  for example  what is learned about the physiology of   yeast   cells can also apply to human cells  the field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of   human physiology   to non human species  plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fields physiology studies how for example   nervous system nervous      immune system immune      endocrine system endocrine      respiratory system respiratory    and   circulatory system circulatory   systems  function and interact  the study of these systems is shared with   medicine medically   oriented disciplines such as   neurology   and   immunology      evolutionary     current research in evolutionary biology evolutionary research   is concerned with the origin and descent of   species    as well as their change over time  and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines  for example  it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular   organism  s such as   mammalogy      ornithology      botany    or   herpetology    but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution evolutionary biology is partly based on   paleontology    which uses the   fossil   record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution   and partly on the developments in areas such as   population genetics    and evolutionary theory  in the 1980s    developmental biology   re entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the   modern synthesis   through the study of   evolutionary developmental biology     related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are   phylogenetics      systematics    and   alpha taxonomy taxonomy      systematics     s eight major taxonomic ranks  intermediate minorrankings are not shown  this diagram uses a 3   domain  biology  domain  s   6   kingdom  biology  kingdom  s format  multiple   speciation   events create a tree structured system of relationships between species  the role of   systematics   is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species  however  systematics was an active field of research long before evolutionary thinking was common  the classification    taxonomy    and nomenclature of biological organisms is administered by the   international code of zoological nomenclature      international code of botanical nomenclature    and   international code of nomenclature of bacteria   for animals  plants  and bacteria  respectively  the classification of   viruses      viroids      prions    and all other sub viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the   international committee on taxonomy of viruses international code of virus classification and nomenclature        however  several other viral classification systems do exist traditionally  living things have been divided into five kingdoms    monera      protist  a    fungus fungi      plant  ae    animal  ia  however  many scientists now consider this five kingdom system outdated  modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the   three domain system      archaea    originally archaebacteria     bacterium bacteria    originally eubacteria     eukaryote eukaryota    including   protist  s    fungi      plants    and   animal  s   these domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not  as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors   in terms of   metabolism metabolic   activity  meaning that many scientists do not actually classify these structures as alive  due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions that define life  they are classified as   virus  biology  viruses      viroid  s    prion  s  or   satellite  biology  satellites   the scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species  for example  humans are listed as     homo sapiens        homo   is the genus  and   sapiens   the species  when writing the scientific name of an organism  it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase  additionally  the entire term may be italicized or underlined   the dominant classification system is called the   linnaean taxonomy    it includes ranks and   binomial nomenclature    how organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the   international code of botanical nomenclature    icbn   the   international code of zoological nomenclature    iczn   and the   international code of nomenclature of bacteria    icnb  a merging draft    biocode    was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas  but has yet to be formally adopted   the biocode draft has received little attention since 1997  its originally planned implementation date of january 1  2000  has passed unnoticed  a revised biocode that  instead of replacing the existing codes  would provide a unified context for them  was proposed in 2011     however  the   international botanical congress   of 2011 declined to consider the biocode proposal  the   virus classification international code of virus classification and nomenclature    icvcn  remains outside the biocode    ecology     image common clownfish jpg thumb 250px right mutual   symbiosis   between   clownfish   of the genus   amphiprion   that dwell among the tentacles of tropical   sea anemone  s  the territorial fish protects the anemone from anemone eating fish  and in turn the stinging tentacles of the anemone protects the clown fish from its predators     ecology   studies the distribution and abundance of   life living organisms    and the interactions between organisms and their   natural environment environment     the   habitat   of an organism can be described as the local   abiotic factors   such as   climate   and   ecology    in addition to the other organisms and   biotic factors   that share its environment   one reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible  even on small scales  a microscopic   bacterium   in a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the african   savanna    for any species    behavior  s can be   co operation co operative      aggression aggressive      parasite parasitic    or   symbiosis symbiotic    matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an   ecosystem   ecological systems are studied at several different levels  from individuals and   population  s to   ecosystem  s and the   biosphere    the term   population biology   is often used interchangeably with   population ecology    although   population biology   is more frequently used when studying   diseases      viruses    and   microbes    while population ecology is more commonly used when studying plants and animals  ecology draws on many subdisciplines   ethology   studies animal   behavior    particularly that of social animals such as   primate  s and   canidae canids     and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology  ethologists have been particularly concerned with the   evolution   of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of   natural selection    in one sense  the first modern ethologist was   charles darwin    whose book      the expression of the emotions in man and animals      influenced many ethologists to come    biogeography   studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the   earth     focusing on topics like   plate tectonics      climate change      biological

over whether it is itself an entity  a relationship between entities  or part of a   conceptual framework   debates concerning the nature  essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity  namely  to treatises like the   timaeus   of   plato    or   socrates   in his reflections on what the greeks called     khora      i e   space    or in the   physics   of   aristotle    book iv  delta  in the definition of   topos    i e  place   or even in the later  geometrical conception of place  as  space   qua   extension  in the   discourse on place      qawl fi al makan    of the 11th century arab polymath   alhazen     many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century  particularly during the early development of   classical mechanics    in   isaac newton   s view  space was absolute in the sense that it existed permanently and independently of whether there were any matter in the space   other   natural philosopher  s  notably   gottfried leibniz    thought instead that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects  given by their   distance   and   direction  geometry  direction   from one another  in the 18th century  the philosopher and theologian   george berkeley   attempted to refute the  visibility of spatial depth  in his   essay towards a new theory of vision    later  the   metaphysic  ian   immanuel kant   said neither space nor time can be empirically perceived  they are elements of a systematic framework that humans use to structure all experiences  kant referred to  space  in his   critique of pure reason   as being  a subjective  pure     a priori and a posteriori a priori     form of intuition   hence it is an unavoidable contribution of our human faculties in the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine   non euclidean geometries    in which space can be said to be   curved    rather than   flat    according to   albert einstein   s theory of   general relativity    space around   gravitational field  s deviates from euclidean space   experimental   tests of general relativity   have confirmed that non euclidean space provides a better model for the shape of space   philosophy of space     leibniz and newton     right thumb 150px  in the seventeenth century  the   philosophy of space and time   emerged as a central issue in   epistemology   and   metaphysics    at its heart    gottfried leibniz    the german philosopher mathematician  and   isaac newton    the english physicist mathematician  set out two opposing theories of what space is  rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above other matter  leibniz held that space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in the world   space is that which results from places taken together    unoccupied regions are those that   could   have objects in them  and thus spatial relations with other places  for leibniz  then  space was an idealised   abstraction   from the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be   continuous probability distribution continuous   but must be   discrete probability distribution discrete    space could be thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members  although people in the family are related to one another  the relations do not exist independently of the people  leibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe  but since there would be no observational way of telling these universes apart then  according to the   identity of indiscernibles    there would be no real difference between them  according to the   principle of sufficient reason    any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible universes  must therefore be wrong    left thumb 150px  newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on   observation   and   experiment  ation  for a   relationism relationist   there can be no real difference between   inertial frame of reference inertial motion    in which the object travels with constant   velocity    and   non inertial reference frame non inertial motion    in which the velocity changes with time  since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions  but newton argued that since non inertial motion generates   force  s  it must be absolute   he used the example of   bucket argument water in a spinning bucket   to demonstrate his argument    water   in a   bucket   is hung from a rope and set to spin  starts with a flat surface  after a while  as the bucket continues to spin  the surface of the water becomes concave  if the bucket s spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin  the concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water   instead  newton argued  it must be a result of non inertial motion relative to space itself  for several centuries the bucket argument was decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter    kant      in the eighteenth century the german philosopher   immanuel kant   developed a theory of   knowledge   in which knowledge about space can be both   a priori   and     analytic synthetic distinction synthetic       according to kant  knowledge about space is   synthetic    in that statements about space are not simply true by virtue of the meaning of the words in the statement  in his work  kant rejected the view that space must be either a substance or relation  instead he came to the conclusion that space and time are not discovered by humans to be objective features of the world  but are part of an unavoidable systematic framework for organizing our experiences     non euclidean geometry     is similar to   elliptical geometry    on the   surface   of a   sphere   there are no   parallel line  s   euclid s   elements   contained five postulates that form the basis for euclidean geometry  one of these  the   parallel postulate   has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries  it states that on any   plane  mathematics  plane   on which there is a straight line   l sub 1  sub    and a point   p   not on   l sub 1  sub     there is only one straight line   l sub 2  sub    on the plane that passes through the point   p   and is parallel to the straight line   l sub 1  sub     until the 19th century  few doubted the truth of the postulate  instead debate centered over whether it was necessary as an axiom  or whether it was a theory that could be derived from the other axioms   around 1830 though  the   hungary hungarian     j nos bolyai   and the   russia  n   nikolai ivanovich lobachevsky   separately published treatises on a type of geometry that does not include the parallel postulate  called   hyperbolic geometry    in this geometry  an   infinity infinite   number of parallel lines pass through the point   p    consequently the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180  and the ratio of a   circle   s   circumference   to its   diameter   is greater than   pi    in the 1850s    bernhard riemann   developed an equivalent theory of   elliptical geometry    in which no parallel lines pass through   p    in this geometry  triangles have more than 180  and circles have a ratio of circumference to diameter that is less than pi    class  wikitable  style  margin  1em auto 1em auto  style  text align center

        although there was a prevailing kantian consensus at the time  once non euclidean geometries had been formalised  some began to wonder whether or not physical space is curved    carl friedrich gauss    a german mathematician  was the first to consider an empirical investigation of the geometrical structure of space  he thought of making a test of the sum of the angles of an enormous stellar triangle and there are reports he actually carried out a test  on a small scale  by   triangulation triangulating   mountain tops in germany     henri poincar     a french mathematician and physicist of the late 19th century introduced an important insight in which he attempted to demonstrate the futility of any attempt to discover which geometry applies to space by experiment   he considered the predicament that would face scientists if they were confined to the surface of an imaginary large sphere with particular properties  known as a   sphere world    in this world  the   temperature   is taken to vary in such a way that all objects expand and contract in similar proportions in different places on the sphere  with a suitable falloff in temperature  if the scientists try to use measuring rods to determine the sum of the angles in a triangle  they can be deceived into thinking that they inhabit a plane  rather than a spherical surface   in fact  the scientists cannot in principle determine whether they inhabit a plane or sphere and  poincar  argued  the same is true for the debate over whether real space is euclidean or not  for him  which geometry was used to describe space  was a matter of   conventionalism convention     since   euclidean geometry   is simpler than non euclidean geometry  he assumed the former would always be used to describe the  true  geometry of the world     einstein      in 1905    albert einstein   published a paper on a   special theory of relativity    in which he proposed that space and time be combined into a single construct known as   spacetime    in this theory  the   speed of light   in a   vacuum   is the same for all observers mdash which has   relativity of simultaneity the result   that two events that appear simultaneous to one particular observer will not be simultaneous to another observer if the observers are moving with respect to one another  moreover  an observer will measure a moving clock to   time dilation tick more slowly   than one that is stationary with respect to them  and objects are measured   length contraction to be shortened   in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer  over the following ten years einstein worked on a   general theory of relativity    which is a theory of how   gravity   interacts with spacetime  instead of viewing gravity as a   force field  physics  force field   acting in spacetime  einstein suggested that it modifies the geometric structure of spacetime itself   according to the general theory  time   gravitational time dilation goes more slowly   at places with lower gravitational potentials and rays of light bend in the presence of a gravitational field  scientists have studied the behaviour of   binary pulsar  s  confirming the predictions of einstein s theories and non euclidean geometry is usually used to describe spacetime   mathematics  in modern mathematics   mathematical space spaces   are defined as   set  mathematics  sets   with some added structure  they are frequently described as different types of   manifold  s  which are spaces that locally approximate to euclidean space  and where the properties are defined largely on local connectedness of points that lie on the manifold  there are however  many diverse mathematical objects that are called spaces  for example    vector space  s such as   function space  s may have infinite numbers of independent dimensions and a notion of distance very different to euclidean space  and   topological space  s replace the concept of distance with a more abstract idea of nearness   physics     classical mechanics   space is one of the few   fundamental quantity fundamental quantities   in   physics    meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because nothing more fundamental is known at the present  on the other hand  it can be related to other fundamental quantities  thus  similar to other fundamental quantities  like   time   and   mass     space can be explored via   measurement   and experiment    relativity   before   einstein   s work on relativistic physics  time and space were viewed as independent dimensions  einstein s discoveries showed that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one object  mdash    spacetime    it turns out that distances in   spacetime space like_interval space   or in   spacetime time like_interval time   separately are not invariant with respect to lorentz coordinate transformations  but distances in minkowski space time along   space time interval  s are mdash which justifies the name in addition  time and space dimensions should not be viewed as exactly equivalent in minkowski space time  one can freely move in space but not in time  thus  time and space coordinates are treated differently both in   special relativity    where time is sometimes considered an   imaginary number imaginary   coordinate  and in   general relativity    where different signs are assigned to time and space components of   spacetime     metric tensor metric    furthermore  in   einstein s general theory of relativity    it is postulated that space time is geometrically distorted    curved    near to gravitationally significant masses  experiments are ongoing to attempt to directly measure   gravitational wave  s  this is essentially solutions to the equations of general relativity  which describe moving ripples of spacetime  indirect evidence for this has been found in the motions of the   hulse taylor binary   system    cosmology   relativity theory leads to the   cosmology cosmological   question of what shape the universe is  and where space came from  it appears that space was created in the   big bang    13 7 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since  the overall shape of space is not known  but space is known to be expanding very rapidly due to the   cosmic inflation     spatial measurement  the measurement of   physical space   has long been important  although earlier societies had developed measuring systems  the   si international system of units     si   is now the most common system of units used in the measuring of space  and is almost universally used currently  the standard space interval  called a standard meter or simply   metre meter    is defined as the   speed of light distance traveled by light in a vacuum   during a time interval of exactly 1 299 792 458 of a second  this definition coupled with present definition of the   second   is based on the   special theory of relativity   in which the   speed of light   plays the role of a fundamental constant of nature   geographical space    geography   is the branch of science concerned with identifying and describing the   earth    utilizing spatial awareness to try to understand why things exist in specific locations    cartography   is the mapping of spaces to allow better navigation  for visualization purposes and to act as a locational device    geostatistics   apply statistical concepts to collected spatial data to create an estimate for unobserved phenomena geographical space is often considered as land  and can have a relation to   ownership   usage  in which space is seen as   property   or territory   while some cultures assert the rights of the individual in terms of ownership  other cultures will identify with a communal approach to land ownership  while still other cultures such as   australian aboriginals    rather than asserting ownership rights to land  invert the relationship and consider that they are in fact owned by the land    spatial planning   is a method of regulating the use of space at land level  with decisions made at regional  national and international levels  space can also impact on human and cultural behavior  being an important factor in   architecture    where it will impact on the design of buildings and structures  and on   farming   ownership of space is not restricted to land  ownership of   airspace   and of   international waters waters   is decided internationally  other forms of ownership have been recently asserted to other spaces mdash for example to the   radio   bands of the electromagnetic   spectrum   or to   cyberspace     public space   is a term used to define areas of land as collectively owned by the community  and managed in their name by delegated bodies  such spaces are open to all  while   private property   is the land culturally owned by an individual or company  for their own use and pleasure   abstract space   is a term used in   geography   to refer to a hypothetical space characterized by complete homogeneity  when modeling activity or behavior  it is a conceptual tool used to limit   extraneous variables   such as terrain   in psychology  psychologists first began to study the way space is perceived in the middle of the 19th century  those now concerned with such studies regard it as a distinct branch of   psychology    psychologists analyzing the perception of space are concerned with how recognition of an object s physical appearance or its interactions are perceived  see  for example    visual space   other  more specialized topics studied include   amodal perception   and   object permanence    the   perception   of surroundings is important due to its necessary relevance to survival  especially with regards to   hunting   and   self preservation   as well as simply one s idea of   personal space   several space related   phobia  s have been identified  including   agoraphobia    the fear of open spaces     wikt astrophobia astrophobia    the fear of celestial space  and   claustrophobia    the fear of enclosed spaces    see also
